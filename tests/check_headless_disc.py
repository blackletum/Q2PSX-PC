"""Drive the real client over the whole disc, headlessly, and assert on it.

Every existing check in `tests/` either links a library and calls it directly or
exercises one narrow slice of the client. None of them answers the question a
change to the game actually raises: *does every level on the disc still load,
still render, still run its script, still wake its creatures, and still let a
player shoot one?* This does, by running the shipped client as a subprocess with
`--headless --report` and reading the counters back.

`--headless` is not optional and not a convenience. Without it the client
advances on the wall clock, `dt` varies per frame, and every cumulative number
below is unreproducible; with it the step is a fixed 1/30 s and two runs of the
same case agree exactly.

Both discs are covered and the suite adapts: it asks the client which release
it identified and picks the film names to match, since the three films are
under different names on SLUS-00757.

Run from the repository root:

    python tests/check_headless_disc.py --disc .install/disc/game.cue
    python tests/check_headless_disc.py --disc "<...>/Quake II (USA).cue"

  --client PATH   which binary (default: the staged .install one, else build-msvc)
  --disc PATH     which disc (default: .install/disc/game.cue)
  --output DIR    where logs and captures go (default: .agents/tmp/headless)
  --jobs N        how many runs at once (default: half the CPUs)
  --only PATTERN  run just the cases whose name contains this
  --quick         one zone per map instead of every zone

Exit status is 0 only when every case passed.
