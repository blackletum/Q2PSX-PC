 * test_playerdeath.c — the player death chain's behaviour.
 *
 * Everything asserted here was read out of five functions in SLES_015.34 —
 * 0x800396AC, 0x80039550, 0x8003E238, 0x8005B358 and 0x8003CE14 — and the
 * comments in playerdeath.h carry the addresses. What the tests are for is the
 * behaviour that is easy to get subtly wrong and impossible to see in a
 * screenshot: which deaths make a sound, which one-shots really are one-shots,
 * and the two different endings single player and deathmatch give a body.
