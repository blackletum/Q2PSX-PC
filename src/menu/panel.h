/*
 * panel.h — the light-blue rounded frame the UI screens sit inside.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What it is
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every full-screen text panel — the mission briefing, MISSION COMPLETE, the
 * memory-card questions — is drawn inside the same rounded border with a
 * darkened translucent body behind it. openquestions.md listed that border as
 * unlocated for a long time, with the note that it is *not* in `qk_menu.lbm`.
 * It is in **`frontend.lbm`** (VRAM slot 13), in the strip below the 32-pixel
 * title face, at rows 223 to 255 — the part of the sheet the menu font never
 * reaches because its own tables stop at v = 100 + 11 * rows.
 *
 * Two functions build it:
 *
 *     0x8003F0E4   q2_panel_draw(x, y, w, h)  — the body, then the frame
 *     0x8003E8D0   the frame itself, eight POLY_FT4
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The body
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two TILE primitives, both exactly (x, y, w, h), both **rgb (0, 0, 0)** with
 * the semi-transparency bit set (`code |= 2` at `0x8003F1C8`), bracketed by two
 * draw-mode packets carrying `0xE1000600` — texture page 0, abr **1**, which on
 * this hardware is B/2 + F/2.
 *
 * Black at half strength darkens; drawing it **twice** darkens to a quarter.
 * That is the whole effect, and it is why the panel reads as smoked glass
 * rather than a flat fill: the scene behind it stays visible at 25%.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The frame — eight patches, four of them mirrored
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The sheet holds exactly three pieces of art:
 *
 *     (32, 224) 46 x 29   one corner
 *     (112, 247) 19 x 6   one horizontal edge
 *     (81, 241) 11 x 14   one vertical edge
 *
 * and the builder places eight quads from them. The mirroring is done the way
 * the hardware wants it — by **writing the screen corners in reverse order**
 * against ascending texture coordinates, not by flipping the UVs. The top-right
 * corner's x runs from `x + w + 10` down to `x + w - 36` while its u runs 32 up
 * to 78; that is the same instruction sequence as the top-left with two
 * expressions swapped, and it is why one corner of art draws four corners.
 *
 * Every quad is code **0x2D** — POLY_FT4 with the *raw* bit, so the texture is
 * not modulated by the primitive's colour, and without the ABE bit, so the
 * frame itself is opaque over the body it just darkened.
 *
 * The frame overhangs the rectangle it is given: 10 pixels left and right, 6
 * top and bottom. A caller that wants the border flush with a box has to inset
 * the box, and the console does exactly that — the briefing's box is (96, 32,
 * 336, 100) inside a 512-wide framebuffer, leaving 86 either side.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Ordering
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The body and the frame go into two different ordering-table slots 24 bytes
 * apart (`base + 11824` and `base + 11848`), which is six buckets. The port
 * takes the same shape as two bucket arguments rather than hard-coding the
 * gap, because this port's table is sliced differently (screen.h).
