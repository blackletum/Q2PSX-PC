/*
 * menumouse.h — what is under the pointer, in the console's own menu space.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is a module and not four lines in the client
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The console had no pointer, so nothing in the executable answers this
 * question and there is nothing here to transcribe. What there IS, and what
 * this module is bound to, is menudraw.c: every rectangle below is the exact
 * inverse of a rectangle that module emits, so a page that draws its slider
 * somewhere is a page whose slider can be grabbed there. Written inline in the
 * client the two would drift the first time a face metric changed, and the
 * failure would be silent — a control that looks right and cannot be hit.
 *
 * It is also the only part of mouse support that can be tested without a
 * window, which is why it takes coordinates rather than events.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The space
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `x` and `y` are in the console's 512x248 framebuffer — the same space every
 * item record's x/y is in (menu.h). A host works in window pixels and has two
 * transforms to undo first: the window-to-framebuffer fit, and the origin the
 * 512x248 block is centred at inside a larger buffer. Both belong to the
 * caller, because both are the caller's own choices.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The rows are hit at their WIDEST
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A toggle draws "LABEL ON OFF" under the cursor and "LABEL ON" — one word,
 * whichever is current — when it is not (0x8001B670). Hit-testing what is
 * currently drawn would make a row's box grow as the pointer entered it: you
 * would aim at OFF, the row would not be under the pointer yet, and the word
 * would only appear once you had already hit something else. So the box is
 * always the selected form's, which is the form the row is in by the time
 * anyone clicks it. Colour codes are not printable and cannot change a width,
 * so this agrees with `q2_menu_item_display` on every other widget exactly.
