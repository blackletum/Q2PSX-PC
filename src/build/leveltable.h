/*
 * leveltable.h — the executable's level table, and cross-map progression.
 *
 * Zone gates move the player between zones of one map. Moving between MAPS
 * needs this table, which is the only place a display name is tied to a
 * directory on the disc.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Layout
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 53 records of 56 bytes, at file offset 0x84EC8 in the PAL executable:
 *
 *     +0x00  char[12]  display name    e.g. "Base0", "COLD STORAGE"
 *     +0x0C  char[12]  directory name  e.g. "BASE0" — the Q2DATA/LEVELS folder
 *     +0x18  s32       always 0
 *     +0x1C  s32       always 0x80050008 — a pointer, identical in every record
 *     +0x20  u16       always 1 on a real level
 *     +0x22  u8[7]     the music playlist — see below
 *     +0x29  s8        -7: the playlist's loop-back
 *     +0x2A  u8[2]     the terminating zero, never reached
 *     +0x2C  s32[3]    always 0
 *
 * The stride was established empirically rather than assumed. Scanning for
 * mixed-case names with an uppercase twin nearby gives 31 hits, and the gaps
 * between them are 56 in 24 of 30 cases — the outliers being the records whose
 * display name is not a simple capitalisation of the directory.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The bytes at +0x22, which ARE the music playlist
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file used to describe +0x23..+0x27 as a five-byte run of unknown
 * meaning, +0x22 as unrelated, and +0x28 as `0xF900 | n`, and it declined to
 * call any of it music because that was only suggestive. The player's own
 * cursor walk at `0x80071A68` settles it, and the earlier split was a misread:
 *
 *     p = cursor;  cursor = p + 1;  v = *cursor
 *     v == 0   ->  the list is over
 *     v <  0   ->  cursor += v          (a relative jump BACK)
 *     id = *cursor;  the id names a stream through musictable.h
 *
 * So +0x22..+0x28 are **seven track ids**, +0x29 is `0xF9` — minus seven, which
 * lands the cursor back on +0x22 — and +0x2A is the terminating zero that is
 * therefore never reached. Every level loops a seven-track playlist. What
 * looked like a word `0xF900 | n` was the seventh id, the loop byte and two
 * zeros read together.
 *
 * The seven are a lead track and then six consecutive ones from lead + 3,
 * wrapped into 2..17: BASE0 is 14 then 17, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; BASE1 is 8 then
 * 11..16; BASE2 is 19 then 6..11; JAIL2 is 2 then 5..10.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two records that are not levels
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * "BADLEVEL" is an error placeholder. The final record pairs two names with an
 * all-zero body and is a terminator rather than a map. Both are reported so a
 * caller can skip them deliberately instead of trying to load them.
