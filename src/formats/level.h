/*
 * level.h — the chunk schema of COMMON.DAT and ZONE*.DAT.
 *
 * These names were recovered by taking a census of every level file on the disc
 * (`q2psx-inspect dats`), not by reading one file and guessing. The census over
 * the PAL build reports:
 *
 *   COMMON.DAT — 49 files, 14 chunks each, 2 schema variants.
 *                The only variation is BIGGUN, which carries one extra chunk
 *                ("GlintMod"). Every other name is present in all 49 files.
 *
 *   ZONE*.DAT  — 115 files, 5 schema variants, 12 or 14 chunks.
 *                The 14-chunk variant adds "CreAIRel" and "CreAIBin", the same
 *                pair COMMON.DAT carries. 98 of 115 zones have them.
 *
 * Two consequences for the loader:
 *
 *   1. The name set is closed. Every chunk on the disc maps to one of the enums
 *      below, so chunks can be resolved to a typed slot at load time.
 *   2. A chunk's directory *index* is not stable across files — the census marks
 *      most ZONE chunks "var". So lookup must be by name, never by position.
 *      That is why q2_level_chunk_index() exists rather than a constant table.
 *
 * What each chunk is believed to hold is documented in docs/FORMATS.md; this
 * header deliberately only commits to what the census proves, which is the name
 * set, the cardinality and the optionality.

 * `dst = src` produces a `dst` whose every chunk lookup dereferences whatever

 * pointer into a stack frame that had been reused. Every other chunk on those
 * maps was being read the same way and happened to still find its old bytes.
 *
 * `q2_common_move` copies the archive, re-resolves the directory against the
 * DESTINATION's own storage, and empties the source. The re-resolution is the
 * point: it is the same call `q2_common_open` makes, so there is one place that
 * knows how a directory is built.
