/*
 * main.c — the playable client.
 *
 * Opens a disc, loads a zone, and lets you fly through it in real time. The
 * internal framebuffer is the console's own — 512x248, read out of the display
 * init at 0x800764DC rather than assumed — and is upscaled to the window. That
 * is not a concession to performance; rendering at the original resolution is
 * part of looking right, because the dither pattern and the vertex snapping are
 * both defined in terms of real pixels.
 *
 * Upscaled, NOT stretched to fill. A framebuffer pixel is two thirds as wide as
 * it is tall on a PAL television — every one of the GPU's horizontal modes spans
 * the same active line, so 512 columns are narrow columns, not a wider picture —
 * and putting the buffer on a window one-for-one is a 1.5x horizontal stretch
 * that makes a correctly reconstructed field of view read as a wrong one. The
 * shape is q2_screen_fit_rect's, the window may be any size or aspect, and V
 * cycles the choice. See the pixel-aspect section of src/screen/screen.h.
 *
 * The frame is put together the way the console puts one together: swap, one
 * background clear, then each viewport into its own slice of a single 217-entry
 * ordering table, then one walk of that table with the draw-env packets in it
 * doing the clipping. See src/screen.
 *
 * Controls
 *   W/A/S/D      move
 *   Q/E          down / up
 *   arrows       look
 *   shift        move faster
 *   1..9, 0      switch zone
 *   F1           toggle dithering
 *   F2           toggle affine UVs (perspective-correct comparison)
 *   F3           toggle the ordering-table sort
 *   F4           toggle simulated movement vs free-fly camera
 *   F5           cycle the console's viewport layouts (one, the two splits,
 *                the 2x2, and the boot screen's single-buffered full screen)
 *   F6           show the GlintMod glint (BIGGUN only; off by default because
 *                nothing the engine does turns one on — see effect.h)
 *   F7 / F8      the memory-card front end, saving and loading
 *   F9 / F10     quick save and quick load, slot 1
 *   F11          screenshot, of the 512x248 framebuffer rather than the window
 *   P            toggle the view's own world position and angles along the
 *                top of the frame, in the units --at, --yaw and --pitch
 *                take. Not the console's: nothing on this disc puts a
 *                position on screen. `--coords` starts a run with it up
 *   V            cycle how the picture is shaped: the console's own pixel, the
 *                raw buffer, a forced 4:3, or filling the window
 *   space        jump — and, held, swim up. One key because it is one BUTTON:
 *                the pad's tail writes bit 22 from its press edge and bit 21
 *                from it being held (pad.h)
 *   up/down      look — and holding BOTH is the console's own view recentre,
 *                which is a chord rather than a setting (0x8003A780)
 *   ctrl / c     hold a crouch. The one key here that is NOT the console's:
 *                crouching is authored per map as a trigger volume, and this
 *                asserts the same flag such a volume would (worldscale.h). The
 *                map's own crouch volumes work without it
 *   Esc          the pause menu — and QUIT GAME inside it leaves
 *
 * The mouse
 *   move         look. The three MOUSE control styles are the console's own —
 *                0x80019224 and the two after it — so this selects one rather
 *                than adding a tenth: USE MOUSE on the CONTROLLER page decides
 *                which class of styles that page offers, exactly as the
 *                connected controller decides it at 0x8001C8A8, and on a PC
 *                the mouse is what is connected. MOUSE SPEED is its
 *                sensitivity and SWAP Y AXIS inverts it
 *   mouse 1      attack        mouse 2      jump — and, held, swim up
 *   wheel        next / previous weapon
 *
 * Both buttons are the scheme's rather than this port's choice: RIGHT MOUSE
 * fires on the mouse's left button and jumps on its right, because the console
 * merges the pair into L3 and R3 and that is which mask each one feeds.
 *
 * Turning USE MOUSE off puts the styles back to the STANDARD group and every
 * key below keeps working unchanged — the keyboard is bound to MEANINGS through
 * q2_pad_style_bindings, not to pad buttons, so a style change moves what a key
 * means instead of breaking it. Under a mouse style the arrows have no look
 * buttons to press and drive the look AXIS instead, so they still turn.
 *
 * In the menu the keyboard stands in for the pad, because the menu engine is
 * written against the console's 16-bit button mask and nothing is gained by
 * giving it a second input model:
 *
 *   arrows       d-pad          Enter / Space   cross   (select)
 *   Esc          triangle       Backspace       triangle (back)
 *
 * and the mouse is a pad too, with the two things a pad cannot say — land on
 * THAT row, set that slider to THAT value — going through menu.c's pointer
 * entry points instead (menumouse.h):
 *
 *   move         highlight the row under the pointer
 *   mouse 1      select it; on a toggle, aim at the ON or OFF word; on a
 *                slider, click or drag the bar itself
 *   mouse 2      back, which is triangle — and on the pause page, where
 *                triangle has no parent to go to, it closes the menu as Esc
 *                does
 *   wheel        move the cursor
 *
 * The two save keys are the port's, and the reason they exist is that the
 * console's own route to SAVE? is not reachable here: on the disc that prompt
 * is reached from the front end and at a level boundary, neither of which this
 * client has. Everything BEHIND the prompt is the console's — the screens, the
 * four rows, the release rule and the state machine (memcard.h, saveui.h).

     * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     * There is ONE device stream, and `SDL_PutAudioStreamData` APPENDS to it.
     * It is a FIFO, not a mixer. Music was pushed into it a sector at a time
     * and every effect was pushed into the same FIFO, so an effect did not
     * play with the music — it played AFTER everything already queued, and it
     * pushed the music further back by its own length.
     *
     * That is what made the sound "randomly ongoing". The music pump tops up
     * only while the queue is under its target, so it stops contributing as
     * soon as effects fill it; the effects do not stop, because footsteps,
     * creature idles and weapon fire keep arriving. The queue therefore grew
     * without bound and the device played out an ever-later backlog of
     * unrelated effects, minutes behind the thing that raised them.
     *
     * Two further faults rode along with it. The stream is declared STEREO at
     * XA's 37800 Hz because that is what the music is, and a bank effect is
     * MONO at its own 11025 or 22050 (vag.h) — so each effect was read as
     * interleaved stereo, splitting alternate samples across the two channels,
     * and played back between 1.7 and 3.4 times too fast.
     *
     * So the effects go through voices instead: twenty-four of them, which is
     * the SPU's own count and the number the comment on the menu path always
     * claimed this had. Each one decodes its sample a block at a time, steps
     * through it at the ratio between its rate and the stream's, and is summed
     * into the music bed. One push per chunk, mixed, at the stream's format.

     * 34 of them on the disc and 33 reachable by a volume. The total is how
     * many the map's script carries; the found count is how many DISTINCT ones
     * have run. Distinct is the port's choice and is stated: the event runtime
     * fires a volume on entry rather than continuously, so walking in and out
     * of one would otherwise count the same secret twice, and a secrets figure
     * that climbs as you pace about is the one shape that is definitely wrong.
     *
     * KILLS are the creature world's: how many of the map's placed creatures
     * are dead. Both totals are per MAP, so both reset with it.
     *
     * "Per MAP" is what `zone_dead`/`zone_placed` are for. The console keeps
     * one live kills word (`0x800B29E8`, stamped into the row by `0x80022420`
     * on every death) and one live total (`0x800B29E4`, counted once out of
     * the whole of Common.Dat at `0x8007AB34`), and clears neither at a zone
     * boundary — the only writer of zero is `0x80070874`'s level reset. The
     * port cannot hold the count the same way: `client_load_creatures` frees
     * and rebuilds the creature set at every zone load, so every `dead` flag
     * and the `cre_in_zone` denominator go with it, and the tally reported
     * only the zone the player happened to be standing in.
     *

     * LEFT, and the level's figure is the sum with the resident zone's half
     * recomputed live. Indexed by zone rather than accumulated, so walking
     * back through a gate into a zone already visited replaces that zone's
     * slot instead of counting it twice. Cleared with `secrets_found`, on a
     * real level change and not on a gate.
     *
     * `secrets_total` needs no such treatment and does not get one: it is

     * THIS PORT PLAYED IT AS AN IDLE ATTRACT REEL. IT IS NOT ONE. The title

     *
     *   the title's idle   module+0x12DC0, parked with 9000 by the title page
     *                      builder 0x8010CEE0 and counted down by the page
     *                      hook 0x8010C6AC, which resets it to 9000 whenever
     *                      engine+0x2AC says the pad moved. At zero it calls
     *                      0x80101B08 — and that function plays NO FILM. It
     *                      hides the five title objects, installs the one-row
     *                      page `"DEMO OF GAME"` (module+0xC) and hands off.
     *                      9000 of the console's 1/300 s units is the thirty
     *                      seconds this port had, and what waits at the end of
     *                      it is a DEMO OF THE GAME, which this port has no
     *                      player for. So the countdown is gone rather than
     *                      pointed at the wrong film.
     *
     *   the reel's beat    module+0x12D90, parked with 150 by 0x80101E4C and
     *                      counted down by the page hook 0x80101CD0:
     *
     *     80101E54  addiu v1, zero, 150
     *     80101E6C  jal   0x80103414
     *     80101E70  sh    v1, 11664(v0)     ; -> module+0x12D90, delay slot
     *     ...
     *     80101CF4  lhu   v0, 0x2D90(a0)    ; the beat
     *     80101D00  subu  v0, v0, v1        ; ...minus the frame delta
     *     80101D0C  bgez  v0, +0x128        ; still counting: do nothing
     *     80101D34  addiu a0, a0, 0xDC4     ; "ROGUEINP.STX"
     *     80101D38  addiu a1, zero, 2457
     *     80101D4C  jal   0x8010B2EC        ; play it
     *
     * The store hid its writer in a DELAY SLOT eight instructions below its own
     * `lui`, which is why a scan that pairs a `lui` with a nearby load or store
     * found only the reader and read the whole thing as an idle timeout with an
     * unrecoverable threshold. It has a writer, and the writer has three
     * callers: 0x8010D380, 0x8010D3A8 and 0x8010D3D4 — the EASY, MEDIUM and
     * HARD records at module+0xEFE4 / +0xEFFC / +0xF014. Each stores its skill
     * into engine+0x366 and calls 0x80101E4C, which arms 150, hides the same
     * five title objects and installs the countdown as the page hook.
     *
     * So the reel is what plays WHEN A DIFFICULTY IS CONFIRMED, and 150 of the
     * same 1/300 s units is HALF A SECOND — the beat between the title going
     * away and the film starting. Nothing about it is this port's invention any
     * more, threshold included.
     *
     * One more thing this cost, and it is worth recording. `0x8010D5F8` — a
     * standalone `play("ROGUEINP.STX", 2457, ...)` and nothing else, which is
     * what `docs/FORMATS.md` recorded as the attract reel's call site — has
     * ZERO references in all 118 KB of the module. It is an earlier build's
     * entry point left in, and it looks exactly like the live one.

 *     ...
 *     80061FCC  jal   0x8004874C         ; deliver one traced pellet
 *     80061FD4  slti  v0, s0, 5          ; five, and the module cannot say
 *     80061FD8  bne   v0, zero, 0x80061F78
 *
 * — five. The Soldier's module passes twelve (crebind.h) and 1000/500 of
 * spread, and the engine reads neither: its `lhu s1, 112(sp)` is the only
 * stack argument 0x80061ED0 or 0x8004874C ever touches, and that is the
 * trace's cell hint, not the module's. So a shotgun guard's blast is at most
 * 5 x 2 = 10 points on the console, where this port was delivering 12 x 2 =
 * 24 — two and a half times the damage, at every range.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL MISSING, stated rather than hidden: the jitter. Each pellet
 * adds `((rand() - 16384) << 10) >> 14` to components 0 and 1 of the aim
 * (0x80061F80..0x80061FC4), which is applied to a direction the routine has
 * already scaled `<< 2` — so it is +/- 1/16 of a unit vector, the same
 * shift-on-`rand() - 16384` scheme this console uses for the player's own
 * spread (weapon.c) rather than id's `crandom() * hspread`. Reproducing it
 * needs a per-pellet trace against the player's hull, which this hook does not
 * have; until then every pellet that has line of sight still lands, and the
 * count is the half of it that is a transcribed figure.
 *
 * `monster_fire_bullet` (+0x84, 0x80061DFC) has no jitter at all — one trace,
 * no `rand()` — so a machinegun guard's single exact shot is already right.

 * actor's knockback (+0x2F8, which the dispatcher reads as halfwords and adds
 * to +0xE0 for the throw — 0x8007D100..0x8007D134 in the default Chest arm,
 * the same `lhu` pair in the others), the posed mesh 0x8005B320's blood spray
 * walks, and the area byte the spray's groups carry (+0x9E):
 *
 *   - The mesh comes through client_fx_mesh, the hook the damage effects use,
 *     so the spray samples the same last-drawn pose the crackle does. It is
 *     asked while the record is still in play — q2_monster_corpse_tick clears
 *     `in_use` only after the dispatch returns. This is not one of combat's
 *     asks, so the hook's three counters are put back and `gib_mesh_posed`
 *     counts it instead.
 *   - The area is the SecondaryCol cell byte at `pos`: the lookup this
 *     client's creature draw makes for the same body's sort area, so the spray
 *     sorts with the body it came out of. Which hull the console's own
 *     creature +0x9E comes from is not traced — INFERRED.
 *
 * A PLAYER is placed only here: +0x54 is the ORIGIN frame, Q2_EYE_BASE above
 * the feet (sim.h), `vel` is +0xE0 in the same raw units (per dt before the
 * mover's Q2_VEL_DIV), and `impulse` is the +0x2F8 accumulator itself. The
 * death record's own `velocity` (playerdeath.h, "+0xE0") is never handed the
 * body's in this port — its init zeroes it and only the corpse friction
 * touches it after — so the sim's is used. +0xA4 is taken as the same
 * point — INFERRED; the player's draw origin is not reconstructed.

 * console does. Every map's `LevelBin` init looks its `MapTitle` up and hands

 * `0x800222B8`: find the row of six whose name matches, else take the first
 * whose name is empty, and stamp the live counters into it. BASE1's module
 * does it in five instructions at `80100434`..`80100448`.
 *
 * Registering on arrival is what makes re-entering a level keep its row rather
 * than take a second one, and it is what lets the counters be written into the
 * row as they move — which is the other half of the console's model
 * (`0x800223A8` for a secret, `0x80022420` for a kill).
 *
 * **NOTHING CLEARS IT BETWEEN UNITS, and this used to.** The table is a
 * CAMPAIGN's six rows, not a unit's, and the clear the port invented for the
 * unit boundary was the last guess left in this screen. Where the only clear
 * in the executable actually is:
 *
 *     0x8003D62C(player, 0)  looks up a block by the key "PlayerSave"
 *                            (0x8007FBEC) and, when it finds one, copies six
 *                            25-byte records out of it at +0xD4 into
 *                            0x8009B550 and hands the loaded level's counters
 *                            back with 0x80022210.
 *     0x8003DDB8             the `else` of that: memset(0x8009B550, 0, 150).
 *
 * So the six rows are cleared when there is no player block to restore — a new
 * game — and at no other time. The one place a per-unit clear belongs,
 * `0x80022498` in the MISCOMPLETE arm between the board's setup and its spin,
 * is a six-iteration loop with no body; and no engine export hands a level
 * module the array's address, so a module cannot clear it either.
 *
 * The consequence is the console's and the port now reproduces it: six rows,
 * first six distinct levels, and a seventh registers nothing. A player reaches
 * unit 2's board having visited exactly six levels, so that board is full, and
 * unit 3's shows the same six. That is a defect in the original rather than a
 * design, and it is transcribed here rather than tidied because a board that
 * lists a unit's own levels is a screen the console does not draw.

 * hands it: walk the 56-byte records comparing `+0` and take `+0x0C` as the
 * directory. The port used to use the operand as a directory outright, which
 * happens to work for every single-player transition on this disc — all
 * thirteen name a map whose display name is its directory in a different case
 * — and would silently fail on any record where the two differ, of which the
 * table has plenty (`COLD STORAGE` is `MATRIX6`). It is also what the console
 * would do: a name the table does not carry reaches `0x8007C684`, an
 * unconditional branch to itself. This warns and tries the name as a directory

     * writes **7** into the game-state word at `0x800B2E28`. Nothing else.
     *
     * Exit 7 is `0x80018ED8`, which `screen.h` had listed by number with no
     * name. Reading it names it: it tears the level's two module images down,
     * runs the outer state machine until it answers, and then either loads
     * `"Extro FMV"` on answer 5 — the ending — or `"EndMission N"` with the
     * digit at index 11 patched from `0x800B2E20` (`lbu`/`addu`/`sb` at
     * `0x8001900C`..`0x80019028`). Those are the `QENDMIS1`..`QENDMIS5` maps
     * the level table carries as `EndMission 1`..`EndMission 5`.
     *
     * So a MISCOMPLETE ends a UNIT rather than a level, and the port does what
     * it can read: raise the mission screen — which already says
     * "Mission N - Complete" — and go to that unit's end-of-mission map,
     * resolved by DISPLAY name because "EndMission N" is a display name and
     * not a directory.

     * The outer state machine is not reconstructed, so the choice between
     * `EndMission N` and `Extro FMV` is made here from the unit the map
     * declares rather than from that machine's answer. Stated, because it is
     * the one invented step: unit 5 is the last on this disc.
     *
     * BOTH BRANCHES NOW EXIST. The `Extro FMV` half used to be a comment about
     * a path the port did not take — the last unit went to `EndMission 5` like
     * every other, and the outro was started from there because that was the
     * only place a film could be started from. `Extro FMV` is a level table
     * record (index 11) resolving to QFMV, QFMV plays the film its module names
     * for that screen, and so the campaign now ends the way 0x80018ED8 ends it.

     * AND WHICH SCREEN GOES UP, WHICH IS TWO QUESTIONS AND NOT ONE.
     *
     * THIS BLOCK USED TO ARGUE THE OPPOSITE AND IT WAS WRONG. It reasoned:
     * `xrefs 0x800A3314` finds the {"LOADING",256,124} record materialised by
     * exactly one instruction, inside 0x80079178; `xrefs 0x80079178` finds two
     * callers, the ZONEGATE opcode (0x80027828) and the TELEPORT primitive
     * (0x80028ACC); both are zone changes inside one map; therefore a LEVEL
     * change raises no loading screen. Every one of those facts is true, and
     * all 21 callers of the page-enter 0x8001A384 really do pass something
     * other than 46 except that one. The conclusion is still wrong, because
     * THE LEVEL SCREEN IS NOT A MENU PAGE and a search for menu pages could
     * never have found it.
     *
     * The executable's own symbol table names both (SLUS-00757 /MAIN.SYM,
     * through the PAL->USA relocation; docs/FORMATS.md §9.13):
     *
     *   0x80079178  MaybeLoadZoneName   LOADLEV.C  -- the ZONE screen
     *   0x8006E150  TestIt              TITLE.C    -- the LEVEL screen
     *
     * `ProcessGame` (0x80018A10, MAIN.C) is the only thing that changes level,
     * and its body is: 0x80018C6C `jal 0x8007C54C` GetLevelData, 0x80018C88
     * `jal 0x8006E150` TestIt, 0x80018C90 `jal 0x8007CA44` LoadLevel,
     * 0x80018C98 `sw zero, 0x800B2D94`, 0x80018CA8 MainGameLoop. TestIt clears
     * both ordering tables (0x8006E188, 0x8006E194), calls InitLoadingAnim
     * (0x80038DFC) and InitialiseVBlankLoading (0x8006DFB8), and that last
     * function ends at 0x8006E144 with `sw 0x8006E288, 0x800B2D94` -- which
     * installs VBlankLoading as the VERTICAL-BLANK HOOK the ISR calls at
     * 0x8001908C. Every vblank from then until FadeOutLoading (0x8007C8F8)
     * spin-waits for it at 0x8007C914 and unhooks at 0x8007C92C draws a whole
     * frame -- DoubleTrebleBuffer, PutDispEnv, DrawOTag, ClearOTag,
     * VBlankMainLoop -- while the CD read blocks. A level change on this
     * console shows an ANIMATED screen for several seconds.
     *
     * MaybeLoadZoneName's is the other one, and this port SHOWS NOTHING FOR IT.
     * On the console it is a still that covers a CD read: enter page 46,
     * present one frame, and let the deferred load at 0x8007901C run after it,
     * during which nothing is drawn at all. Here a zone load is a handful of
     * milliseconds off a file on disk with no frame to cover, so putting the
     * word up buys nothing and costs the one thing a zone seam must not cost
     * -- a visible break. A zone change is seamless.
     *
     * It also had a fault that made the case for the rule. The zone still was
     * raised with `timed = false`, and `q2_loading_step` only takes a screen
     * down when a hold runs out; nothing else called `q2_loading_hide` on the
     * success path. So the word went up at the first gate and STAYED up, over
     * a world that was still running underneath it -- a bar that never
     * finished, which is what a frozen game looks like from the chair.
     *
     * A load that changes no directory -- a death, a restart, an arena round
     * reset, a memory-card restore -- raises nothing either, which is what the
     * console does with those too.
     *
     * Raising it does not draw anything. It arms the screen, and the main loop
     * owns every frame that follows -- deliberate: presenting from inside a
     * load would swap the buffers under a frame that has not begun, and a
     * headless capture numbers its shots by frame.
     *
     * `c->running` stays, and still means the load that STARTS the run: main
     * sets it on the line before the frame loop, so `--map`, `--zone-probe`
     * and the front end being opened at startup are setup rather than
     * transitions, and `--frames 1 --shot` photographs the level rather than
     * the screen (AGENTS.md).
     *
     * NOT REPRODUCED: the level screen's animation. The console runs a whole
     * scene graph off the vertical blank for the length of the read; this port
     * puts up the same word and the same turning logo for a fixed hold,
     * because its own load is milliseconds and there is nothing to fill.

                     * This is the reported teleport, and both previous answers
                     * to it were wrong in the same way: they placed the player
                     * somewhere. First at the zone's first StartPos, then — on
                     * the theory that a gate "really does have to move the
                     * player" because zones occupy different regions of one
                     * coordinate space — at a named 'InZone<N>' entry point.
                     * Neither cured it, because the premise was never tested.
                     *
                     * It is false. `--zone-probe` takes every trigger volume
                     * whose script reaches a ZONEGATE, takes the volume's own
                     * centre, and asks the DESTINATION zone's movement hull
                     * which cell holds it. Across BASE1, BASE2, BASE3, LAB,
                     * SECURITY, POWER1, POWER2, JAIL2, JAIL5 and BIGGUN, all
                     * ONE HUNDRED gates land in a real cell of the zone they
                     * name, and most land in a real cell of BOTH zones at once
                     * — BASE1's trigger 4, for one, resolves in zone 0 and in
                     * zone 1's cell 216.
                     *
                     * A gate is a DOORWAY. The volume straddles the seam
                     * between two adjacent regions of one space, and crossing
                     * it streams the next zone in around a player who has not
                     * moved and does not stop walking. The evidence for the old
                     * premise was a single measurement of BASE1's zone-0 SPAWN
                     * point against zone 1 — the START of zone 0, twenty-seven
                     * thousand units from any gate, which of course resolves
                     * nowhere and never meant anything.

         * THE LOAD-TIME SCRIPT PASS — the named event "STARTLEV", which the
         * zone loader runs at EVERY level and zone load and which this port
         * never ran at all.
         *
         * 0x8007C290 `addiu t0,a0,-10920` materialises the twelve bytes at
         * 0x800AD558 — `53 54 41 52 54 4C 45 56 00 00 00 00`, "STARTLEV" — and
         * 0x8007C324 `jal 0x80027CC4` runs it, inside the zone loader
         * 0x8007B3F8 that 0x800794D8 calls on every load. 0x80027CC4 is the
         * engine's own named-event runner and a transitive drain: it seeds the
         * queue at 0x800C6F24 (0x80027D60..0x80027D74) and runs everything the
         * chain TRIGGERs through the usual gate and latch (0x80027DA0..
         * 0x80027DC8), which q2_event_rt_update's drain_pending reproduces.
         *
         * The pass is bracketed by two flags, `addiu v0,zero,1` stored into
         * 0x800B281C (0x8007C2A4) and 0x800B2834 (0x8007C2AC) and cleared at
         * 0x8007C330/0x8007C338. The second is `initial_pass`, and every hook
         * that must go quiet during a rebuild already honours it.
         *
         * IT IS NOT GATED ON THE CARRY and it comes BEFORE the replay:
         * 0x80079114 calls the loader, and only then does 0x80079120..
         * 0x80079130 test 0x800AEBCC and call the replay. So a spent ENABLE
         * the replay re-dispatches correctly re-opens what STARTLEV has just
         * closed, and deathmatch — which skips the replay — still gets the
         * pass. Skipping it on the carry path would put all 22 records back on
         * their feet at every zone seam: q2_event_rt_init reseeds the flags
         * from disc and the carry only restores records whose bits are
         * (DISABLED|HASRUN) both set, which a STARTLEV disable is not.
         *
         * WHAT IT DOES ON THIS DISC, walked from each COMMON script's STARTLEV
         * directory entry: 18 of the 49 scripts have one, and their TRIGGER
         * closures DISABLE 22 records on eight maps — LAB alone shuts twelve,
         * eleven of them named by trigger volumes the player walks through, so
         * five doors, two button-and-lift pairs, a CREBATCH ambush and a
         * message were all live from frame 0. The other half of the pass is
         * the raising: 13 TIMEDLIGHT, 8 TIMER, 2 SIMROT2, 2 LASERWALL, 1
         * LIFT1, 1 PLATFORM, 1 MISEVENT and 72 LASERBEAM. Not one MOVER_A/B/C
         * and not one ZONEGATE in any of the eighteen, so the pass cannot move
         * a door or ask for a zone while the level is still being built.
         *
         * The 72 LASERBEAM and 2 LASERWALL calls are no-ops in
         * client_event_call, which implements neither: the beams are already
         * raised by q2_laserbeams_build, which is where the console's own
         * registration pass raises them (levelbin.h), and nothing here can
         * double-register one or deal LASERWALL damage at load.

         * answer. The delay and wait arms are `lhu`/`subu`/`sll 16`/`blez`
         * there (0x800258C8..0x800258E0, 0x80025978..0x8002599C) and
         * `(s16)(timer - dt) > 0` in mover.c; the travel is a 32-bit `mult` by
         * the `lw` dt (0x80025AA4..0x80025AB8), clamped to the target, in

         * them. The pusher each mover think calls (0x80051EC0) is

         * holds the last ATTEMPT, so on the frames between ticks it still reads
         * `fired`, and the third outcome above was unreachable from here: a held

     *

     * accumulator reaches Q2_DT_NOMINAL, which at any frame rate above 25 Hz
     * is a minority of frames — and this rolled `prev` on EVERY frame, so an
     * edge raised on a non-ticking frame was destroyed before any tick could
     * see it. Bit 22, the jump, is the only control in the game that exists
     * solely as a single-frame edge and is consumed solely inside the tick, so
     * it is the one that broke: measured against this exact accumulator
     * arithmetic, 48 of 200 presses survived at 60 Hz and 33 at 144 Hz.
     * Holding the key longer did not help — `derive` clears the bit from the
     * second frame on, because `was` is true by then.

     * So the roll is deferred to the frames that tick, and the raw pad is
     * accumulated into `pend` in between. The OR is an addition the console
     * does not have and needs a name: it catches a tap that begins and ends
     * inside one 40 ms tick interval, which retail never had to because its
     * tick rate WAS its frame rate. Without it a fast tap on a 240 Hz display

 * What the tick asked to be heard.
 *
 * A think has no audio path of its own — it records what it would have played
 * and the caller drains it (entity.h) — and so does the player's own frame. This
 * is the other end of both: the queue is cleared at the TOP of a tick precisely
 * so the caller can drain it afterwards (sim.c), and the drain cannot miss one,
 * because q2_sim_advance runs the world exactly once per frame with a variable
 * dt rather than sub-stepping (sim.h).
 *
 * The LIGHT and BURST events are not consumed. Both are real and both are
 * dropped rather than faked: a glow light wants a q2_light_world for the entity
 * draw to gather from and the client has none yet, and the pickup burst is a
 * particle effect whose emitter is not reconstructed. An item therefore glows
 * through its own tint (entitydraw.c) and vanishes without sparks, which is less
 * than the console does rather than something the console does not do.

/*
 * THE ELEVEN ITEM SOUNDS, and the SUBSTITUTIONS a map that is missing one gets.
 *
 * 0x800374BC resolves the eleven names into gp+17032..gp+17072 once per map,
 * and 0x80037B24 then PATCHES the slots that came back null. This port resolved
 * by name at every play instead, so there was nowhere for a patched slot to
 * live and a map whose bank lacks a name simply played nothing.
 *
 * The chain, read at 0x80037B24..0x80037BCC. Slots are four bytes apart from
 * gp+17032, so 17044/17048/17052 are slots 3/4/5 and 17056/17060 are 6/7:
 *
 *   17048 || 17052 null -> BOTH take the OR, i.e. whichever one loaded

 *   17044       null    -> takes 17048
 *   17056 || 17060 null -> BOTH take the OR, the same idiom
 *   17056 still null    -> BOTH take 17032
 *
 * The other five get no fallback and stay silent, which is also the console's
 * behaviour rather than an omission here.
 *
 * Held as NAMES rather than bank indices because everything downstream plays by
 * name; a patched slot is simply the donor's name copied into it.

 * The watchdog behind `--zone-trace`.
 *
 * A player walks; a player does not jump 2,000 units in a thirtieth of a
 * second. Anything that does is a relocation, and the only question worth
 * asking about it is whether something MEANT to do it. Every deliberate path —
 * the zone gate, the TELEPORT primitive, a spawn, a map change, the number-key
 * zone hotkeys — leaves its name in `move_reason` on the way past, so a jump
 * that arrives with the field empty was nobody's decision and is the fault.
 *
 * The threshold is the console's own scale: Q2_VIEW_STAND is 576, so 2,000 is
 * a bit over three standing heights and no run, fall or lift covers it in one
 * frame. The cell the player lands in is reported with it, because a relocation
 * INTO a valid cell and one into no cell at all are different bugs.

/*
 * `--zone-probe` — where does a zone gate actually LEAVE you?
 *
 * The reported fault is "suddenly teleporting you to a different part of the
 * map when you reach the end of a zone", and the first answer to it assumed a
 * gate must move the player, on the strength of one measurement: BASE1's zone-0
 * SPAWN point resolves to no cell in zone 1. That measurement proves nothing.
 * The spawn point is the START of zone 0; a gate fires at its END, tens of
 * thousands of units away. The question was never whether the zone-0 spawn is
 * inside zone 1 — of course it is not — but whether the GATE's own doorway is.
 *
 * So this asks that. For every trigger volume whose script reaches a ZONEGATE,
 * it takes the volume's centre and asks the DESTINATION zone's movement hull
 * which cell holds it. A gate that lands in a real cell of the zone it names is
 * a doorway between two adjacent regions of one coordinate space, and the
 * console has nothing to do on arrival but keep walking. A gate that lands
 * nowhere needs an arrival point, and that arrival point has to be found.
 *
 * The destination's StartPos points are resolved in the same hull, so the two
 * answers can be read against each other rather than argued.
