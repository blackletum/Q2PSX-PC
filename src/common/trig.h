 * Angles are a full circle in 4096 steps, not radians and not degrees. That is
 * what the console's libraries used, what the game's stored angles are in, and
 * what keeps rotation matrices in the 1.3.12 format the GTE expects. Converting
 * to radians and back would introduce rounding the original never had.
 *
 * Results are 1.3.12: +4096 is +1.0, -4096 is -1.0.
 *
 * The table is built once at first use from the host's libm. That is a
 * deliberate trade: the *table* is computed in floating point, but every
 * subsequent use is exact integer arithmetic, so results are reproducible across
 * platforms as long as the table is. A future change could hard-code it if a
 * platform's libm ever disagreed at the ulp level.

 * (0x800678B8 calls RotMatrix at 0x80089E38 on the object's +0x0C triple), and
 * what the VIEW WEAPON builds its clip rotation with.
 *
 * THE ORDER HERE WAS WRONG, and the reason it survived is worth keeping. This
 * said `Rz * Ry * Rx` and justified not checking: "the composition order is
 * unobservable on this disc — the rotation integrator at 0x8002F1A8 stores to
 * obj[0x0C + 2*axis] and nothing ever clears the other two slots, so exactly
 * one angle is non-zero and the three orders agree." That is true, for a
 * ROTATING BRUSH. It stopped being true when the view weapon became a caller:
 * a clip's rotation carries all three angles at once — the blaster's idle is
 * (2078, 2110, 1985) — and the two orders agree only when the roll is zero.
 * An argument that a difference cannot be seen is only as good as the list of
 * things looking, and that list grew.

 * The camera, with the console's ANAMORPHIC term in it — 0x80055DE4.
 *
 * The world draw loads its matrix from view+160 (0x800313DC), and 0x80037F44
 * builds that by scaling a basis ROW BY ROW: row 0 by `vw / 320` and row 1 by
 * `vh / 240`, the divides at 0x80055DFC's 0x66666667 and 0x80055E8C's
 * 0x88888889. `vw` is the immediate 320 at 0x800779BC and `vh` the immediate
 * 160 at 0x80077948, so the console's camera is `diag(1, 2/3, 1) * basis` and
 * its effective projection is (H, 2H/3).
 *
 * The port had `diag(1, 1, 1)` and H = 160, so it rendered (160, 160): the
 * vertical right and **the horizontal one and a half times too wide**. Measured
 * against a native-resolution capture of the BASE0 spawn, with the 2D briefing
 * panel proving both frames share a framebuffer origin and width:
 *
 *     sky wedge above the panel   console 136 px   before 90 px   after 135 px
 *     weapon emitter, x           console 325..337  before 301..307  after 322..333
 *     weapon emitter, y           console 157..166  before 157..166  after 157..167
 *
 * The vertical was already exact and stays exact; the horizontal closes from
 * 27 pixels of error to 3.
 *
 * WHICH HALF CARRIES IT IS AMBIGUOUS and the ambiguity is worth stating. The
 * console reaches (240, 160) as H = 240 with row 1 at two thirds; this reaches
 * the same place as H = 160 with row 0 at three halves. The pictures are
 * identical. This form is used because it leaves every viewport's VERTICAL
 * untouched — the split-screen layouts carry their own projection distances and
 * none of them has been measured, so scaling their verticals on the strength of
 * one full-screen capture would be the riskier half of the same guess.
 * 0x800781F0, which would settle it by naming the distance, is reached only as
 * a function pointer (0x80079CB4) and can be called by a relocated module.
