/*
 * modelent.h — MODEL ENTITIES: a CastList model spawned into the world as a
 * short-lived actor, with its own think, its own clock and its own death.
 *
 * The port already had model entities in one narrow sense — an ITEM is one, and
 * `entitydraw.c` will draw anything in the set that names a model. What it did
 * not have is the thing the engine calls when something needs to APPEAR: a
 * transient entity that is not an item, has no pickup, and removes itself when
 * its clip runs out. `explosive.h` had to say so out loud:
 *
 *     "0x8005A778 spawns a MODEL ENTITY ... This port has no such subsystem"
 *
 * This is that subsystem. `0x8005A778` was its first decoded caller and the
 * creature import table already carries the address under the name
 * `spawn_explosion` (creature.h, +0x120), so every creature module on the disc
 * can reach it too. The GIBS are the second family and have their own section
 * at the end of this file: 0x8007CEB4, 0x8005A3D4, 0x8005A0AC, 0x8005AD8C,
 * 0x8005B0AC and the gib think 0x80059DE0.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The spawn — 0x8005A778(origin, surface, radius, kind)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   1. `0x8006C098(1)` allocates out of the 48-entry, 768-byte pool at
 *      0x800CBA28. The argument is "you may EVICT to make room": with fewer
 *      than 48 free the allocator scans the pool for an entity whose +0xF4 is
 *      non-zero AND whose +0x10C carries bit 0x01000000, frees that one
 *      (0x8006D280) and takes its slot. So a transient entity is exactly one
 *      that carries those two marks, and the marks are what make it
 *      recyclable under pressure rather than a leak.
 *
 *   2. The name is chosen by the fourth argument and there are only two:
 *      0 -> "Explosion" (0x800ACDF4), 1 -> "Hexplosion" (0x800ACE00). Anything
 *      else skips the bind entirely and lands on the `ent+0x10 == 0` test
 *      below, which throws the entity away.
 *
 *      `Hexplosion` IS ON NO MAP. 34 of the disc's 49 CastLists carry
 *      `Explosion` and 0 of 164 banks carry `Hexplosion`, so kind 1 is a
 *      binding with nothing behind it — every caller that asks for it gets
 *      the same nothing an unknown kind gets. Opcode 0x08 always passes 0
 *      (explosive.h), which is consistent with that and not a coincidence.
 *      The other 15 maps are the front-end and cinematic containers.
 *
 *   3. `0x8006D008` walks the model list at gp+18196 comparing TWELVE BYTES at
 *      record+8 and returns the record, or zero. The result goes to ent+0x10,
 *      and `0x8005A894` bails the whole spawn when it is zero — a map whose
 *      CastList does not carry the name gets NO entity, not an invisible one.
 *
 *   4. ent+0x3C = 0x8005A5F8, the think below.
 *
 *   5. ent+0xF8 = `0x8006D100(entity)`, which is `lh(model + 0x1C)` — the
 *      model's own vertical extent. The box is built from it:
 *
 *          mins = (-256, h - 512, -256)      0x8005A97C..0x8005A99C
 *          maxs = ( 256, h,        256)      0x8005A9A4..0x8005A9CC
 *
 *      and then ent+0x78..0x8C is that box biased by the origin at ent+0x54,
 *      which is `entity_absolute_bounds` done inline.
 *
 *   6. ent+0x90 = 128, ent+0x9E = the SURFACE byte (the second argument),
 *      ent+0xA0 = ent+0xA2 = -1.
 *
 * `explosive.h`'s caller passes `scene[node].area & 0x7F` for the surface and
 * a fixed 4096 for the radius, so both of those are already decoded on the
 * other side.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The think — 0x8005A5F8
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *     ent[+0x100] += 2 * dt                       ; dt is 0x800B2DB4
 *     if (ent[+0x100] >= lh(model + 2) * 10)   ; +2 is the TOTAL clip length
 *         remove(ent)                             ; 0x8006D280
 *     ent[+0xFE] = clamp(25 * (320 - ent[+0x100]), 0, 4096)
 *     outer = clamp(51 * (320 - t), 0, 4096) * 1300 / 4096
 *     light(ent+0xA4, C0/40/31, outer * 3 / 4, outer, style 0)
 *
 * THREE THINGS ABOUT THAT ARE LOAD-BEARING.
 *
 * **The clock is the port's `frame` and it does NOT wrap.** +0x100 is the same
 * field an item advances (`e->frame += w->dt`, item.c) and the same one
 * `entitydraw` turns into an animation frame. An item wraps it against
 * `clip_length`; this does not — it runs past the end and the entity dies
 * instead. Wrapping it would give an explosion that loops for ever.
 *
 * **It advances at TWICE the item rate.** `sll v1, v1, 1` at 0x8005A618, before
 * the add. So a 40-frame clip is 400 clock units and 200 ticks of `dt`, not
 * 400.
 *
 * **The lifetime is TOTAL-ANIMATION-LENGTH x 10.** `a0 * 4 + a0` then doubled,
 * at 0x8005A630, over `lh(model + 2)` — which is the sum of every clip's
 * frames and not the current clip's, on 1,723 of 1,723 models
 * (`q2psx-inspect modelents`). It matters only for a multi-clip effect model,
 * and `Explosion` has one clip of 40 — so it lives 400 units. Its lighting
 * ramp has already reached zero by then, as the code below records.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * +0xFE is a SECOND lighting intensity, and the draw multiplies the two
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `0x8006B298` builds the GTE light matrix from BOTH:
 *
 *     8006B298  lh   v1, 252(s2)      ; +0xFC, the one this port already has
 *     8006B29C  lh   v0, 254(s2)      ; +0xFE, the one it did not
 *     8006B2A4  mult v1, v0
 *     8006B2BC  sra  a1, v1, 11       ; ...and the product scales each row
 *
 * The destination passed as `a1` is 0x800DDD1C; 0x8006BBD4 immediately installs
 * it with SetLightMatrix. The model rotation installed next is independently
 * composed from entity+0x2C0. At 0x8006B468 the same product scales the ambient
 * back colour, so +0xFE changes illumination and never geometry.
 *
 * That is why `q2_entity.fade` defaults to Q2_ONE_12 and not to zero: an
 * entity that forgets to set it would otherwise render black.
 *
 * The ramp itself is `25 * (320 - t)` clamped into [0, 4096]. It sits at the
 * ceiling until t = 156 and then falls to nothing at t = 320 — so an explosion
 * holds full brightness for the first 39% of its life and darkens over the
 * rest. Its mesh does not shrink.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The tail is a dynamic light, not a sprite
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The think's tail (0x8005A6E4..0x8005A764) computes a second ramp —
 * `clamp(51 * (320 - t), 0, 4096) * 1300 / 4096`, then three quarters of it —
 * and hands both radii to `0x80075C34`. That address is the runtime-light
 * appender reconstructed as `q2_light_add_dynamic`: it writes one 28-byte
 * light into the sixteen-entry world list bounded by 0x800E3ED8. It is not a
 * primitive emitter and does not draw a translucent quad.
 *
 * The colour operand at 0x800AEAD4 is C0/40/31 and the style/size bytes at
 * 0x800AEAB4 are both zero. The port raises that exact light through the
 * entity-event seam every tick, so the explosion model lights actors around
 * it just as retail did.

/*
 * When a body comes apart the engine does not raise a particle burst and call
 * it done. It throws MODELS: `Gib meat` chunks and a `Chest`, each one an
 * entity out of the same 48-slot pool the explosion comes from, each with its
 * own think, its own blood trail and its own lifetime. The port had none of
 * this — a gibbed creature set a bool, a gibbed player changed a stage, and
 * nothing was thrown.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Who gets here — 0x8007CEB4, the destruction dispatcher
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Three callers, and they are the whole list (`xrefs 0x8007CEB4`):
 *
 *     0x80039578  player corpse_think  — `health <= gib_health`, 0x8003956C
 *     0x8003E2A4  player respawn_think — the same test, 0x8003E270
 *     0x8007F764  the creature CORPSE handler 0x8007F71C, 0x8007F748..0x8007F758
 *
 * All three pass a1 = the address of eight zero bytes (0x800AE86C, 0x800AED04)
 * and the dispatcher never reads a1 before overwriting it — a dead argument.
 *
 * A creature killed straight past its gib threshold goes through the SAME
 * corpse handler: its module's gib arm throws nothing (cre_soldier.c says so
 * at length), it only sets SVF_DEADMONSTER, the body detaches, and the first
 * corpse tick sees `health <= gib_health` and lands here. Every gib on the
 * disc comes out of this function.
 *
 * The class is entity+0xD2, or +0xDA when +0xD2 is 47 (0x8007CEC8..0x8007CEE0:
 * a corpse keeps what it used to be there). `(s16)(class - 2)` indexes the
 * 36-word jump table at 0x800AD648 behind an UNSIGNED `sltiu 36`, so class 0,
 * class 1 and anything past 37 all take the default. Read word by word:
 *
 *     class  2 Boss2, 8 Flyer, 11 Hover  0x8007CF14  Explosion model, then
 *                                                    Bos2Gib1 x16 (7, 1, 8)
 *     class 13 Jorg                      0x8007D054  JorgGib1 x16 (7, 1, 9)
 *     class 14 Rider, 37 RiderStand      0x8007D140  nothing but the free
 *     class 17 Parasite                  0x8007D0BC  ThrowGibs(5, no head)
 *     class 24 Boss1                     0x8007CF84  Bos1Gib1 x16 (7, 1, 8)
 *     class 32 Strider                   0x8007CFE0  Explosion model, then
 *                                                    StridGib1 x16 (8, 1, 7)
 *     everything else                    0x8007D0F8  ThrowGibs(5, "Chest")
 *
 * The Strider is table word 30 (0x800AD6C0) and RiderStand word 35
 * (0x800AD6D4); an earlier reading put them at words 28 and 34, i.e. on
 * classes 30 and 36, which are a Chest arm and a Chest arm. The class names
 * are `q2psx-inspect classes`. A PLAYER is class 39 — 0x8003B2B0 `addiu v0,
 * zero, 39` / `sh v0, 210(s1)` in the player spawn — and so takes the default.
 *
 * The impulse every arm hands down is built at 0x8007CF30..0x8007CF68 as
 * `(s16)(+0xE0 + +0x2F8)` per axis — the body's velocity plus its knockback,
 * both read as HALFWORDS with `lhu` — and every arm ends at 0x8007D140 with
 * `0x8006D280(self)`: the body is freed. The explosion arms call 0x8005A778
 * with a radius of 2048 (0x8007CF18); `q2_model_ent_spawn` carries no radius,
 * which is that function's existing omission and not a new one.
 *
 * MAP DATA DECIDES MOST OF THIS. The model list `q2psx-inspect models` prints
 * for each of the 49 maps: 31 carry `Gib meat`, 30 carry `Chest`, one (BOSS2)
 * carries JorgGib1..JorgGib9, and NONE carries a Bos1Gib, Bos2Gib or StridGib
 * model. Three of the four named arms can only ever throw invisible entities
 * on this disc; the Explosion two of them raise first is on 34 maps.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ThrowGibs — 0x8005A3D4(entity, count, impulse, head_name)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   1. `rand()` is the starting yaw (0x8005A404), THEN `4096 / count` is the
 *      step (0x8005A414, with the console's divide-by-zero break at
 *      0x8005A420 — no caller passes zero).
 *   2. 0x8005A440 `jal 0x8005B320(entity)`: the mesh blood spray on ramps 2
 *      and 3, `q2_fx_gib_spray`. Forty-five draws even with no mesh.
 *   3. Per chunk: three draws of `286 * (rand() - 16384)`, rounded TOWARD
 *      ZERO by 16384 (`bgez; addiu 16383; sra 14`, 0x8005A470..0x8005A480),
 *      added to entity+0x54 in x, y, z order — a jitter of -286..285. Then
 *      0x8004E920 clips that point into PRIMARY collision from the parent's
 *      own position and returns the cell it ended in (sp+56).
 *   4. 0x8005A0AC(entity, yaw, impulse, point, cell, 512, "Gib meat"), and
 *      the yaw steps AFTER a1 was loaded (0x8005A568 is the delay slot).
 *   5. If a head name was given, ONE MORE with lifetime 2560, thrown from
 *      entity+0xA4 — the DRAW ORIGIN, unjittered (`addiu a3, a0, 164` at
 *      0x8005A5CC) — at the yaw the loop ended on and the LAST chunk's cell.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * One chunk — 0x8005A0AC, and its boss twin 0x8005AD8C
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   `0x8006C098(0)`: NO eviction, so a full pool drops the chunk — and drops
 *   its six draws with it, since the return is before the first rand().
 *   +0x3C = 0x80059DE0. The twelve name bytes go to 0x8006D008 and the result
 *   to +0x10 with NO test: a name the CastList lacks still makes an entity,
 *   unlike 0x8005A778 which bails at 0x8005A894. +0x10C = 0x01800000
 *   (`lui v0, 0x180`) — the transient bit AND the quick-sort bit. The point
 *   goes to +0xA4 and +0x54. The parent's +0x2AC ambient is copied on top of
 *   a 0x800AEAC8 (40 40 40) write that is therefore dead (0x8005A1E0 then
 *   0x8005A338..0x8005A35C).
 *
 *   Then the throw, in this draw order:

 *     +0xE4            imp.z + trunc(sin*speed/4096)   trunc(sin*speed/4096)

 *     +0xD2            untouched                   48
 *
 *   `cos` and `sin` are `lh 2` and `lh 0` of the 0x800A5430 pair at
 *   `yaw & 0xFFF`. The boss twin clobbers a2 at 0x8005ADF4 without saving
 *   it: the impulse NEVER reaches a boss chunk.
 *
 *   Tail: +0xA2 = -1, +0xA0 = the cell, +0x9E = that cell's byte +32, and
 *   0x8005555C builds a +/-20 box from the three halfwords at 0x800AEACC.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The boss ring — 0x8005B0AC(entity, count, impulse, name, digit, low, high)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ThrowGibs without the spray and without the head: the same start yaw, the
 * same step, the same jitter and clip, and before each chunk
 * `name[digit] = '1' + i` where i starts at `low` and wraps back to `low` once
 * it passes `high` (0x8005B1F0 `addiu v1, s0, 49`, bytes 31 00 03 26). So the
 * FIRST name written is '1' + 1 = '2' — the template's own `...1` is never
 * thrown — and for Jorg (low 1, high 9) one piece in nine is `JorgGib:`, a
 * name no CastList carries. The console writes into the .data template
 * itself; every burst rewrites the digit before its first copy, so that
 * persistence is unobservable and a local copy stands in for it.
 *

 *   - Tumble: THREE draws, `+0xE6.. -= 160 + 2 * (rand() & 31)` when +0xE6 is
 *     even, `+=` when it is odd (0x80046BE0..0x80046CA0).
 *   - Gravity: `+0xE2 += [0x800AE924] * dt`, as a halfword, clamped at 8192
 *     (0x80046464..0x800464A0) unless +0x10C carries 0x2000.
 *   - The move is `vel * dt / 320` (0x66666667 and `sra 7`) through PRIMARY
 *     collision from the +0xA0 cell. On a block the new velocity is the
 *     REFLECTED remaining displacement, normalised (0x8008A588) and scaled to
 *     `|v| * 2304 >> 12` (0x800466F4..0x80046A5C) — 2304 is the 0x0900 word
 *     at 0x800AEAC4, the fourth argument. Contact or not, +0xA0 and +0x9E
 *     then take the cell the move ended in (0x80046ACC..0x80046B0C), so the
 *     trail later in the same think is laid in the new area.
 *   - Then 0x80046CF8: no block clears the rest bit; a block with
 *     `|v|^2 > 0xC34FF` clears it and bumps +0xE6 by one (flipping the tumble);
 *     a slower block SETS it. A gib at rest stops, stops tumbling and stops
 *     bleeding.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What the port carries differently, said once
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - The pool, the CastList, the particle pool, the collision hull and rand()
 *   are all GLOBALS on the console, which is how the dispatcher reaches them
 *   with nothing but an entity pointer. The port's are owned by the sim, so
 *   the owner registers them once with `q2_gib_attach`, and the two death
 *   sites — which have nothing but the dying record — reach them through it.
 * - `q2_entity` has no +0xE0 velocity, no +0x98 movement word, no +0xA0 cell
 *   and no +0x44 of the right meaning for a gib, so those live in a
 *   `q2_gib_body` beside the entity, keyed by set and slot the way item.c
 *   keeps a death drop's flight.
 * - There are Q2_GIB_BODY_MAX of those, the console's whole pool. No console
 *   frame can hold more live gibs than that (it holds fewer: the pool is
 *   shared), and a throw that finds them all held refuses the chunk before
 *   its first draw, the way `0x8006C098(0)` does when the pool is full.
 * - The mover's two ground-normal slots (+0x60, +0x66) are not modelled; the
 *   rest test above overrides the one bit they feed. Its trigger arm
 *   (0x800465F0..0x8004664C) is gated on the high half of the fourth
 *   argument, which 0x80046B98 passes as zero, so a gib never runs it. The
 *   entity sweep (0x80053974) IS modelled, the way item.c's death drop has
 *   it, when the owner hands over `ents`.
 * - The draw consumes only the yaw of +0xE6 (entitydraw.c); the tumble is
 *   kept on all three axes so it is right when the draw is.
