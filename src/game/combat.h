/*
 * combat.h — delivering damage: armour, knockback, splash, hitscan.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The damage function
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Everything that hurts anything goes through 0x80057D54, which twenty-one
 * call sites reach. Its signature is
 *
 *     damage(attacker, target, amount, mod, point)
 *
 * and it does, in this order: record who hit what; apply knockback for the four
 * means-of-death that carry it; run the ACID and LAVA arms; halve the amount if
 * a monster hit a player at the lowest skill; refuse everything while the
 * target is invulnerable; take what power armour absorbs; take what armour
 * absorbs; subtract the rest from health; play the mod's hit sound if the
 * target survived; set the damage-effect timer the mod implies.
 *
 * THE ENVIRONMENT SUIT IS NOT PART OF THAT REFUSAL. The damage function reads
 * client+0xB4 at exactly one instruction — 0x80058230, inside the mod-9 arm —
 * and the general test at 0x80058304 reads only client+0xB0. (The word is read
 * elsewhere in the image: the status bar's powerup walk draws its countdown
 * from it at 0x80035CB0. That reader refuses nothing.) The suit stops acid and
 * nothing else, not even lava: 0x8005828C's arm is the throttle alone and
 * reads neither timer. Both throttles compare STRICTLY and UNSIGNED
 * (`sltu env_next, level_time`), so the tick on which the deadline is reached
 * is still refused; the protection tests are `sltu` as well.
 *
 * WHO MEETS WHAT. 0x800582C8 `beq s0, zero, 0x8005842C` splits the function in
 * two. A target WITH a client block stays in 0x80057D54 for the skill halving,
 * invulnerability, armour, the ONE SHOT KILL rewrite (0x80058394) and the
 * health store. A target WITHOUT one leaves for T_Damage at 0x800584B4, whose
 * first real test is the `takedamage` gate at 0x80062838 — so that bit gates
 * creatures and never gates a player.
 *
 * Two things it does NOT do, and both matter for a port:
 *
 *   - **It does not kill anything.** There is no die callback and no pain
 *     callback. Health goes negative and the entity's own think notices later.
 *   - **For a creature with an AI brain it does not even subtract health.** It
 *     posts the damage to the module through 0x800627F8 and returns; the
 *     module owns the creature's health. Only brainless entities and players
 *     have their health decremented here.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Armour
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two stages, in this order, and the second knows whether the first fired.
 *
 * **Power armour** (0x80057A9C) applies when the player holds one of the two
 * power items (bits 0x18000 of the powerup word) and has cells. It absorbs two
 * thirds of the incoming damage, capped at twice the cells held, and spends one
 * cell for every two points absorbed.
 *
 * **Armour** (0x80057BE4) then takes `(bias + protection * damage) >> 12`,
 * capped at what is left, where `protection` comes from the three-record table
 * described in weapontables.h and the bias is chosen by the SKILL halfword:
 *
 *     80057C0C  lui   v0, 0x800B
 *     80057C10  lh    v0, 0x800B334A       ; skill, NOT 0x800AEBCC
 *     80057C18  bne   v0, zero, 0x80057C24
 *     80057C1C  addiu a0, zero, 2048       ; delay slot: skill != 0
 *     80057C20  addiu a0, zero, 4095       ; skill == 0
 *
 * That bias is a rounding rule, not a fudge: 4095 rounds every non-zero
 * fraction UP, so single-point hits are still absorbed, while 2048 rounds to
 * nearest. So armour on EASY is very slightly stronger against small hits, and
 * Medium and Hard share the weaker bias. This used to be written here and in
 * the code as a deathmatch split, which reads the wrong global — 0x800AEBCC is
 * the deathmatch word and the same function reads it at 0x80057DA8 and
 * 0x800580E0, nowhere near the bias.
 *
 * Mod 8 skips both stages entirely — the only damage class in the game that
 * ignores armour outright.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Knockback
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Only four means of death push: rail, grenade, rocket and bullet. The block
 * is 0x80057EC0..0x80058204 and it reads NO flags word: its only two guards are
 * 0x80057EC0 `beq s4, zero` (the original damage is zero) and 0x80057EC8
 * `beq s6, zero` (no point was supplied), then the four mod tests. The impulse
 * is `unit(target - point) * scale * damage / 2400 >> 4`, where the scale is
 * about 1.95 per unit of a global at 0x800B3358 plus 64 — except when a player
 * hits themselves, where it is about 6.25 instead. That asymmetry is the rocket
 * jump, and it is three times as strong as being hit by someone else's rocket.
 *
 * The impulse accumulates into the target rather than being applied: the engine
 * adds it to a triple at entity+0x2F8 and raises bit 0x4000, and only a living
 * target gets it — a corpse takes the impulse as an absolute value instead of
 * an addition, which is how bodies do not inherit a dead entity's momentum.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Radius damage
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 0x80050810 sweeps a box of the blast radius, rejects anything whose centre is
 * further than `radius + its own radius`, and applies `damage - dist*170/4096`.
 * The falloff coefficient is a length constant and was retuned: PC Quake II
 * loses half a point per unit, which at this world scale would be 0.05 per unit
 * against the console's 0.0415.
 *
 * Three things happen between that falloff and the damage call, and none of
 * them is distance:
 *
 *   - 0x80050A04 `bne a2, s4` / 0x80050A0C `sra s0, s0, 1` — the blast's OWN
 *     owner takes half. The subtraction at 0x80050A08 is in the delay slot and
 *     therefore unconditional; the shift is not, and both precede the
 *     `blez s0` reject at 0x80050A10.
 *   - 0x80050A24 `jal 0x80044C44` — the SWEPT MOVE through the hull
 *     (collision.h's q2_coll_move), from the blast (a1) to the candidate's
 *     origin (a2 = candidate+0x54) through the collision context at
 *     0x800C8E90, with the caller's cell as the starting hint (a3; entity+0xA0,
 *     `lh a1, 160(ent)` at the grenade and rocket sites). It is a trace, not a
 *     separate zone or node query.
 *   - 0x80050A3C `jal 0x80053974` — the clip of the same segment against the
 *     48-slot entity-box table at 0x800CAE10; 0x80050A44 `beq v0, zero`
 *     skips the candidate when a box stops it.
 *
 * A zero from either gate skips the candidate outright, so retail's blast does
 * not go through a wall. `q2_combat_radius_damage` is a pure function with no
 * world, so the pair is injected as one callback: see
 * `q2_combat_radius_damage_traced`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Hitscan
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 0x8004874C is the one bullet path: trace from the muzzle to `origin + dir`
 * — the direction vector carries the range, nothing is normalised — draw the
 * tracer, damage a breakable surface if the world was hit, then re-trace
 * against entities and damage the first one found with mod 18.
 *
 * The rail (0x8004917C) is the same shape with mod 3, and it keeps going: it
 * re-traces from each impact so one shot can pass through several targets.
