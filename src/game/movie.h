/*
 * movie.h — playing a `.STX`: the schedule, the audio and the skip.
 *
 * `stx.h` decodes ONE frame and says so: who schedules frames, against which
 * clock, and what happens to the audio riding in the same file is not the
 * decoder's business. This is that part.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The clock is the container's, not the host's
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A `.STX` is an 8-sector interleave: slots 0-6 carry video and slot 7 carries
 * CD-XA ADPCM. One XA sector is 2016 stereo frames at 37800 Hz = 53.333 ms, and
 * the file gives one of those per eight sectors, so eight sectors of film is
 * 53.333 ms of sound and seven of picture. Two 320x192 frames fit in those
 * seven video sectors on the disc's cadence (6,5,5,5 sectors per frame), which
 * puts the picture at exactly 25.000 fps.
 *
 * That number is FORCED by the container and is not a choice this port makes.
 * A player therefore advances the film on its own accumulated time and not on
 * the game's tick, which is 30 Hz — driving one from the other would drop or
 * double every fifth frame.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What the audio needs that the music path does not
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The XA in a movie is the same codec as the streamed music (`xa.h`) with a
 * different multiplex: music is one channel in four of a `.XAI`, a movie is one
 * sector in eight of a `.STX`. The sound-group layout, the 2304-of-2324 trap
 * and the persistent per-channel history are all shared, so this uses `xa.h`'s
 * decoder and only replaces the sector selection.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Memory
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The three films are 15, 20 and 30 MB. They are read from the disc in a
 * WINDOW rather than whole — a ring of sectors refilled as the cursor advances
 * — because a 30 MB allocation to play a two-minute clip is the sort of thing
 * that works on a development machine and fails on someone else's.

 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Where this comes from, and why a film is not simply played out
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The player is a function in the shared LevelBin module and it takes five
 * arguments. QFMV's two call sites are
 *
 *     play("TAKE1BP.STX", 1281, 0x10000, 1, 255)      ; module 0x80100958
 *     play("OUTRO1P.STX", 1500, 0x10000, 1, 255)      ; module 0x801009CC
 *
 * and QFRONT's OPENING REEL — the film it plays half a second after a
 * difficulty is confirmed, not the title screen's attract loop — is
 *
 *     play("ROGUEINP.STX", 2457, 0x10000, 1, 255)     ; module 0x80101D4C
 *
 * That address matters, because there are two of it. `module+0xD5F8` is the
 * same call with the same five arguments and it has NO CALLERS anywhere in the
 * 118 KB module: an earlier build's entry point, left in the image, and the one
 * this project recorded for years. The live call sits inside 0x80101CD0, the
 * countdown the EASY, MEDIUM and HARD records arm — which is what makes this
 * film the opening of a new game. See `start_beat` in the client for the chain.
 *
 * The second argument is stored (module+0x7384) and read in the frame handler
 * at 0x80102A5C, where it is compared against the STR frame header's own
 * `frame_number` at +0x08:
 *
 *     lw   v1, 8(a1)            ; StrFrameHeader.frame_number
 *     lw   v0, 0x7384(v0)       ; the argument
 *     sltu v1, v1, v0           ; number < limit ?
 *     bne  v1, zero, +16        ; ...keep going
 *     sw   1, 0x7388(v1)        ; else: done
 *
 * — so it is a stop point, and the frame carrying that number is NOT shown.
 * The disc holds 1283, 1559 and 2459 frames, so the console plays 1,280 of the
 * intro, **1,499 of the 1,559 in the outro** — the last 2.4 seconds are on the
 * disc and are never seen — and 2,456 of the opening reel.
 *
 * The other three arguments are read the same way and are not timing: 0x10000
 * is the size in bytes of each of the two VLC buffers, allocated by name at
 * 0x80102F0C / 0x80102F28 ("vlc buffer 0", "vlc buffer 1") and defaulting to
 * 0x20400 when zero; the 1 gates two engine calls; the 255 is pushed at sp+16.
 * None of them changes what a port that is not managing the MDEC's DMA does.
