/*
 * cre_gunner.c — the Gunner, transcribed from its own module.
 *
 * The Gunner ships on two of the disc's thirteen AI maps, POWER1 and WASTE3.
 * Its module is `POWER1 CreAIBin` module 'Gunner', 7,624 bytes relocated, and
 * every address below is inside it at a base of 0x80100000. Class byte 79,
 * animation scale 12, mass 200; the class table's row 10 gives it health 149
 * and gib_health -70.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It is PC Quake II's gunner, line for line
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This started as one transcribed callback — `gunner_attack` — with everything
 * else on the generic handlers. Reading the rest turns it into id's `gunner.c`
 * with the numbers intact, and several of them are not numbers anyone would
 * have tuned to produce a match:
 *
 *     gunner_dodge      module+0x17B4   `random() > 0.25` as rand() < 8193
 *     gunner_fidget     module+0x12C4   `random() <= 0.05` as rand() < 1639
 *     gunner_pain       module+0x15AC   damage <= 10 / <= 25, the three arms
 *     gunner_duck_down  module+0x137C   skill >= 2, `random() > 0.5`,
 *                                       pausetime = level.time + 1 s
 *     gunner_refire_chain module+0x11E8 `random() <= 0.5` as rand() < 16385
 *     GunnerGrenade     module+0x1138   damage 50, speed 600
 *     GunnerFire        module+0x9A8    damage 3, kick 4, spread 300 x 500,
 *                                       enemy lead of -0.2 x velocity
 *
 * 300 and 500 are id's DEFAULT_BULLET_HSPREAD and DEFAULT_BULLET_VSPREAD to the
 * unit, -819/4096 is id's -0.2 lead, and 50/600 is id's `monster_fire_grenade
 * (self, start, aim, 50, 600, flash_number)`. Mass 200 and gib_health -70 are
 * id's gunner as well. Only the health differs: id's 175 against the disc's 149.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The two muzzles are built once, at init
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The module's init calls `pose_blend_two_positions` (import +0x34) twice and
 * keeps the results in its own BSS:
 *
 *     module+0x828   blend(model, 227, 231) -> module+0x1D28   the chain gun
 *     module+0x874   blend(model, 273, 281) -> module+0x1D30
 *
 * `GunnerFire` hands module+0x1D28 to `attachment_local_offset`, and so does
 * export 1, the flash light — which is why they light up in the same place.
 * `GunnerGrenade` does not use either record: it asks
 * `attachment_world_point` for position 273 outright, the first half of the
 * second blend. Import +0x34 has no caller anywhere in the EXECUTABLE — it
 * exists purely for modules — but the Gunner is not the only module that takes
 * it up: the Soldier calls it once (BASE0, module+0xF44), the Infantry once
 * (POWER2), the Arachner twice (POWER1) and the Tank Commander four times
 * (COMMAND). An earlier draft of this comment called the Gunner "the disc's
 * only use of it", which is false and is corrected here.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Three things the spawn function tells us that were not written down
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `module+0xB78` (export 0) writes the word at entity+0x20 twice with masks
 * that also appear, identically, in the Soldier's spawn at `module+0x16F0`:
 * bits 16..17 are set to 2 and bits 18..21 to 5. `gunner_dead` (module+0x134C)
 * and the gib arm of `gunner_die` then rewrite bits 18..21 to 7, and both die
 * arms set bits 22..23 to 2.
 *
 *     bits 16..17   solid       2 = SOLID_BBOX      (id's monster spawn)
 *     bits 18..21   movetype    5 = MOVETYPE_STEP, 7 = MOVETYPE_TOSS
 *     bits 22..23   deadflag    2 = DEAD_DEAD       (monster.c already had this)
 *
 * and, at entity+0x1C, bits 30..31 are a two-bit `takedamage`: `gunner_die`
 * and `gunner_duck_down` set 1 (DAMAGE_YES), `monster_duck_up` sets 2
 * (DAMAGE_AIM), which are id's values for exactly those three lines.
 *
 * ALL FOUR ARE WRITTEN NOW. This used to say none of them had a field in this
 * port's `q2_monster` and that each was named at the point it would have gone;
 * monster.h carries `solid`, `movetype`, `deadflag` and `takedamage` as their
 * own members, with the bit layout above documented there, so the names below
 * are assignments rather than comments. `mass` is the same case, and the spawn
 * hook writes it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two things the census gets wrong about this creature
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Both are the same decoder bug — walking past a `jr ra` into the next
 * function — and both were checked against the module's own tables:
 *
 *   * **Think 13 does nothing.** `q2psx-inspect creatures` reports
 *     `[13] flashlight(+A0)?`, the muzzle-flash light. Method table entry 13 is
 *     written at module+0x94C and it is `module+0x14B4`, which is two
 *     instructions: `jr ra` / `nop`. The `call(+A0)` belongs to **export 1**
 *     at module+0x14BC, the per-object flash-light routine the ENGINE calls
 *     while drawing — not a think. Leaving method[13] NULL here would let the
 *     generic fallback run that mis-decode, so it carries an explicit no-op.
 *
 *   * **The "Runshoot" move is orphaned.** The census attributes 102-107 to
 *     the walk callback. It is installed by a function at module+0x159C with
 *     exactly `gunner_walk`'s shape — `lui / addiu / jr ra / sw` in the delay
 *     slot, four words — sitting immediately after `gunner_walk`'s own `jr ra`,
 *     and `xrefs 0x8010159C` finds zero references of any kind. The disc ships
 *     a Gunner run-and-shoot animation that no code path can reach.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The chain gun is on the far side of two endfuncs
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `gunner_attack` never installs the firing move. It installs 137-143 "Attack
 * Chain", whose endfunc `module+0x11D8` installs 144-151 "Fire Chain" — eight
 * consecutive `GunnerFire` frames — whose endfunc `module+0x11E8` decides
 * between going round again and 152-158 "End Chain".
 *
 * Both are in the module's METHOD TABLE, at indices 3 and 4 (module+0x8CC and
 * +0x8D8), which is what lets `crebind`'s `resolve_endfunc` name them: it looks
 * an endfunc address up among the callbacks and the methods. Index 3 is a bare
 * installer so `chain_endfunc` was already covering it; index 4 is not, so
 * until now the Fire Chain move had a NULL endfunc and looped forever — a
 * Gunner that opened fire never stopped. Filling method[3] and method[4] is
 * what closes the chain.
 *
 * Index 9 (`gunner_dead`) is the same case and matters for the same reason:
 * `module+0x134C` is not a callback either, and the Death move's decoded
 * `endfunc_move` is zero, so `chain_endfunc` could not stand in and the death
 * animation ended in nothing.
 *
 * Indices 5 and 8 are filled because the MODULE registers them, NOT because
 * anything needed them: `resolve_endfunc` (crebind.c) walks the thirteen
 * callbacks BEFORE the method table, and `module+0x127C` is callback 0 while
 * `module+0x131C` is callback 4, so both endfuncs already resolved with these
 * two slots NULL. An earlier draft claimed all three were filled "for the same
 * reason"; only index 9 shares index 4's problem.
 *
 * The full table, read from module+0x8A8..+0x954 into module+0x1D40:
 *
 *     [0] NULL              [5] gunner_stand      [10] gunner_duck_down
 *     [1] GunnerGrenade     [6] gunner_idlesound  [11] monster_duck_hold
 *     [2] GunnerFire        [7] gunner_fidget     [12] monster_duck_up
 *     [3] gunner_fire_chain [8] gunner_run        [13] (empty)
 *     [4] gunner_refire_chain [9] gunner_dead
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is still owed
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two entries left this list. `pain` now takes the damage — monster.h's
 * callback is `void (*)(q2_monster *, s16)` and `q2_monster_damage_reaction`
 * passes T_Damage's own amount — so the three-way flinch split is live rather
 * than pinned to its lightest arm. And `q2_cre_shot` carries the figures, so
 * the damage, speed, kick and spread read out of the two fire thinks are
 * delivered instead of recorded. What remains:
 *
 *   * The muzzle point is not computed. Both fire thinks build a world start
 *     position from the model's own attachment tags; this port has no such
 *     plumbing at the creature layer, and `soldier_fire` already leaves the
 *     same arithmetic to the host.
 *   * Nothing calls `dodge`. Slot 5 is installed — `crebind.c` wires it — and
 *     the executable has no reader for entity+0xF4 at all, which crebind.c
 *     records at length. The handler is here because the module writes it.
 *   * `q2_cre_fire_shot` declines a shot with no enemy or a dead one. That
 *     matches `GunnerFire`, which reads `enemy->origin` and would fault
 *     without one, and it is a GUARD THE GRENADE DOES NOT HAVE: the module's
 *     `GunnerGrenade` aims down `self->angles` and never looks at the enemy,
 *     so a Gunner that would have lobbed one at nothing now holds its fire.
 *     The one path that can reach it enemyless is `gunner_duck_down`, which
 *     nothing calls either.

 * Sounds, and the module names them itself.
 *
 * Fourteen calls to `sound_index_by_name` (import +0x24) in all: seven in the
 * init (first `jalr` at module+0x450, handles stored at module+0x478, +0x4C4,
 * +0x56C, +0x614, +0x6BC, +0x760 and +0x82C) and seven more in the spawn
 * function (first `jalr` at module+0xD58). The init additionally writes an
 * explicit zero to +0x1D18 at module+0x770, which the spawn then fills with
 * `par_atck2`. Each call takes a 12-byte literal by value and the returned
 * handle is stored to a fixed word of module BSS. Eight distinct handle words
 * result. Six of them (+0x1D08, +0x1D0C, +0x1D10, +0x1D14, +0x1D1C, +0x1D20)
 * are written twice, once by each pass; +0x1D24 only the init resolves, and
 * +0x1D18 only the spawn does — the init just zeroes it.
 *
 * The names were read out of `POWER1/COMMON.DAT` at the file offsets the
 * relocation puts module+0x1C8..+0x204 at, so the address-to-name map below is
 * recovered rather than inferred from slot order:
 *
