/*
 * aimove.h — how a creature actually gets from here to there.
 *
 * The PC lineage keeps this in m_move.c, and so does the PSX: one step
 * routine, one direction chooser, one goal follower, and the yaw integrator
 * they all lean on.
 *
 *     M_ChangeYaw        0x80060964
 *     M_walkmove         0x800607F8
 *     M_MoveToGoal       0x8006087C
 *     SV_StepDirection   0x80060334
 *     SV_NewChaseDir     0x80060544
 *     SV_movestep        0x8005FC78
 *     SV_CloseEnough     inline in M_MoveToGoal
 *

 * What is worth knowing before reading the code
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **Step height is 216.** A creature pushes down from 216 above where it
 * wanted to be and accepts the trace's landing point, which is how it climbs
 * stairs without ever computing a slope. With AI_NOSTEP the height drops to
 * 12 — one PC unit — and the creature can only cross flat ground.
 *
 * **A step that turns too far is refused.** SV_StepDirection takes the step,
 * then throws the position away again if the yaw it ended up with is more than
 * 45 degrees off the direction it asked for. That single rule is what stops
 * monsters from sliding sideways along walls while facing you.
 *
 * **Chasing is eight-way, not continuous.** SV_NewChaseDir quantises to 45
 * degrees, tries the diagonal toward the target first, then the two axis
 * directions in an order that a coin flip and the larger delta decide between,
 * then every remaining direction in a randomly chosen rotation, and only then
 * the way it came. The deadband on each axis is 120 units, so a target almost
 * dead ahead produces no lateral component at all.
 *
 * **Flying and swimming creatures never step.** They get two attempts at a
 * direct move, the first with a vertical correction toward the goal's height
 * and the second without, and if both are blocked they simply do not move.
