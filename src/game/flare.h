/*
 * flare.h — the lens flares, and what a light's `type` byte actually selects.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The type byte, which was open question #26
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every one of the 7,814 lights on the disc carries a `type` of 7, 15, 23, 31
 * or 39 — `(n << 3) | 7` for n = 0..4 — and what those five values do was
 * recorded as unknown. They are not "styles" in the Quake sense (there is no
 * animation table anywhere in the image). The flare pass at 0x80075708 splits
 * the byte three ways:
 *
 *     bits 0-2   always 7 on this disc, never read by the flare path
 *     bits 3-5   the FLARE STYLE, 0..4. Style 0 draws nothing; 1..4 select one
 *                of four element lists in the executable
 *     bits 6-7   a SIZE SHIFT: the flare's world reach is 64 << k. Always 0
 *                here, so every flare on the disc is drawn at 64
 *
 * The style is tested before anything else is computed: the per-viewport pass
 * at 0x80075AA4 and 0x80075B58 masks the word at light+16 with 0x3800 and skips
 * the light entirely when it is zero. So a style-0 light lights the world and
 * is never seen; a style-1..4 light also puts a flare on the screen.
 *
 * Disc-wide: 6,183 lights at style 0, 660 at 1, 183 at 2, 2 at 3 and 786 at 4.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What a flare is made of
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A style is a NULL-terminated list of 8-byte elements at 0x800A1FDC,
 * 0x800A2014, 0x800A2024 and 0x800A203C:
 *
 *     u16 kind      1 = glow disc plus a starburst, 2 = plain disc
 *     s16 size      1.12 multiplier on the flare's screen radius
 *     s16 pos       1.12 position ALONG THE LINE from the screen centre to the
 *                   light: 4096 is at the light, 0 at the centre, negative is
 *                   mirrored through it
 *     s16 colour    1.12 multiplier on the flare's colour
 *
 * That `pos` field is what makes this a lens flare rather than a corona: style
 * 1's six elements sit at 1.0, -0.93, -0.25, 0.15, 1.5 and -1.25 of the way
 * along that line, at shrinking sizes and dimming colours. Style 4 is the same
 * list without its last element, style 3 is its first two, style 2 is its first
 * one alone — so the four styles are nested, and the only real authored choice
 * is how much of the flare a given light shows.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Where it is drawn, and how bright
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 0x80075708, per light per viewport:
 *
 *   - the light's position relative to the camera goes through MVMVA against
 *     the view rotation with NO translation (the delta is already relative),
 *     and the flare is dropped if the camera-space Z is under 256;
 *   - the same attenuation the entity lighting uses runs again, but with the
 *     size shift as its scale, so a flare's reach is the light's radius scaled
 *     by 64 << k rather than by 64;
 *   - inside the inner radius the colour is the light's own at full strength
 *     and the SIZE grows as `atten >> 7`; outside it the size pins to 32 and
 *     the COLOUR dims as `colour * atten >> 8`. One expression each side of
 *     4096, which is why a flare blooms as you walk into it and fades as you
 *     walk away.
 *
 * Both element kinds are untextured and additive: the glow is a fan of Gouraud
 * quads bright at the centre and black at the rim, and kind 1 adds eight
 * Gouraud lines radiating from the centre. There is no flare texture anywhere
 * on the disc, which is why looking for one never found anything.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The two ring generators, which are two routines and not one
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The BURST's 12-gon comes from a general n-gon generator at 0x80074E6C. The
 * DISC's hexagon does NOT: 0x800755CC calls 0x80074C4C, a separate routine that
 * is written out flat, reads a single table entry (index 682 — the 60 degrees a
 * hexagon turns by) and mirrors it into all six vertices rather than looking
 * three of them up. Its vertical radius divides by 240 where the generator
 * divides by 240*4096 against a cosine of 4096, and its vertex order starts at
 * the top where the generator starts at the bottom. A hexagon has 180-degree
 * symmetry, so the two agree on the shape and disagree only in the arithmetic —
 * which is why both are transcribed rather than one aliased onto the other.
 *
 * Both read their angles from the executable's own {sin, cos} table at
 * 0x800A5430: 4096 entries of two halfwords, a full turn in 4096 steps.
 * `q2psx-inspect lights` reads all 16,384 bytes of it back off the disc and
 * compares them against this port's `q2_sin12`/`q2_cos12` — 4096 of 4096 in
 * both columns, so the flare geometry stands on the console's own trig.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The frame entry, and the gate
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 0x80075BDC is the whole flare stage: it tests a word at 0x800B2ECC, gives up
 * if the viewport count at 0x800B2C2C is not positive, and otherwise runs
 * 0x800759F0 once per viewport. That gate has exactly one writer in the image —
 * 0x80071448 stores 1 to it during start-up — and nothing ever clears it, so on
 * this disc the flares are unconditionally on and the flag is vestigial. It is
 * named here because a reader finding the branch should not have to go looking.
 *
 * The stage is the sixteenth of the frame (0x8003932C stamps 16 into the
 * profiler's slot before the call), which puts it after the world and before
 * the entity draw. Call order does not decide draw order, though: every flare
 * links into the viewport slice's LAST bucket — `db + 11192 + 204*p`, which is
 * slice bucket 50, the same one the damage flash uses — so with the table
 * running forward a flare paints over everything the viewport drew, which is
 * what a lens flare is.

 * So it is a static zero VECTOR the engine reuses wherever it needs one, and
