/*
 * statusbar.h — the status bar. Health, ammo, armour, and their icons.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The bar this project spent a long time proving did not exist
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FORMATS.md §11.1 asserted, as a *finding*, that Quake II PSX shows no health,
 * ammo or armour readout. It was reached by enumerating every `printf` and
 * `sprintf` site and every reader of the font table, exhaustively — and it was
 * wrong, because the bar renders **sprites**, not characters, and neither
 * instrument can see a sprite. Retail capture settled it.
 *
 * The retraction is in §11.1. What follows is the thing itself.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Where it is drawn from — and it is not a screen
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `0x800337D0` is not "some composite reached through a pointer". It is the
 * **per-viewport draw hook** — the function the one-player layout stores in the
 * view record at `+308`, alongside `0x80033D30` and `0x80034288` for the two
 * splits (screen.h). So the bar is drawn once per viewport, by the same call
 * that draws that viewport's world, and everything about it follows from that:
 * it is anchored to the viewport rather than the screen, it is drawn per player
 * in split screen, and its icons shrink with the viewport.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The anchor — view+304 and view+306
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * screen.h carried these two halfwords as `pad_a` / `pad_b`, unknown. They are
 * the bar's origin: every field's position is a literal offset from them
 * (`0x800337EC` onward), so a layout positions the whole bar by writing two
 * numbers and the fields follow.
 *
 * The layouts already wrote them, which is the confirmation: one player gets
 * **(93, 201)** (`0x80077E60` / `0x80077E6C`) and a split viewport (0, 95)
 * (`0x80077A98`). At (93, 201) the health digits land at x = 22, 46 and 70 with
 * the cross at 93, and the row sits at y = 201 of a 248-line screen — the
 * bottom-left corner retail capture shows, arrived at from the code alone.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The fields
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Seventeen 10-byte records are built on the stack at `sp+200`, each
 * `{s16 x, s16 y, u8 u, u8 v, u8 w, u8 h, u8 palette, u8 slot}` — a rect in
 * the sheet, then a CLUT index and a tpage index. There is NO separate
 * destination size, and this line used to say there was: the emitter at
 * 0x80035EA0 adds bytes 6 and 7 to u and v for the UVs (0x80035FD8-0x8003605C)
 * and to x and y for the vertices (0x80036080-0x800360F0), then resolves byte 9
 * through the tpage table at 0x800DDD3C (0x80036108) and byte 8 through the
 * CLUT table at 0x800E3F2C (0x80036128). They initialise to the 1 x 1 blank at
 * (255, 255) and the sub-draws fill in the real rect.
 *
 * Sorted by x they fall into TWO ROWS. The main row, at the anchor, is **three
 * digits then an icon, three times**, digits 24 apart because a numeral cell is
 * 24 wide, plus a single field far right:
 *
 *     -71  -47  -23   digits, health           +0    icon   (palette 38)
 *     +64  +88  +112  digits, ammo             +135  icon
 *     +179 +203 +227  digits, armour           +250  icon
 *     +330            the WEAPON IN HAND (`0x80037CAC`)
 *
 * A second row sits **24 to 25 above** it, and capture shows what it carries: an
 * icon on the left beside a pickup caption, and a two-digit counter with its own
 * icon on the right.
 *
 *     -71             upper-left icon          (palette 9)
 *     +256 +280       two digits               +330  icon
 *
 * All seventeen start as that 1 x 1 blank — `sb v1, 206(sp)` and `207(sp)` with
 * v1 = 1 at 0x80033808 / 0x8003380C, and the same pair in every record — so
 * the emitter's 1 x 1 skip (0x80035F5C) drops any field no sub-draw fills. The
 * 38 on health's icon and the 9 on the upper-left one are their PALETTE bytes
 * (0x800337FC -> 0x80033810, 0x80033B3C -> 0x80033B50), where every other
 * record takes 8. This paragraph used to call them widths, and q2_sbar_field
 * carried them as `init_w`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The numerals — 0x8009C598
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Ten four-byte `{u, v, w, h}` digit records, all at **v = 168**, **24 x 24**, with
 * `u = 24 * digit`. They sit in the same sheet as the icons, on the row below
 * the icon grid — which is why the sheet decoded to "32 x 24 item icons
 * followed by a set of large digits" and why that was the tell nobody read.
 *
 * Two more records follow: glyph 10 is the minus sign at (0, 192), and glyph
 * 11 is the 1 x 1 blank. The signed readouts use both — the frag counter at
 * `0x80037DA4` and, since health is signed too (0x800352A4), the health one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FOUR LAYOUTS, and this is the one-player one
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The installed hooks build four DIFFERENT layouts, not one table drawn four
 * ways: `0x800337D0` is one player (17 fields), `0x80033D30` two stacked (16),
 * `0x80034288` two side-by-side (16), and `0x80034830` three/four players (11
 * fields per viewport).
 *
 * That last identity is load-bearing. `0x80034288` used to be labelled the
 * quad hook, even though the selector passes it only to `0x80077AEC`, the
 * side-by-side constructor. The actual quad hook is passed to `0x8007771C` and
 * derives x from 44 halfwords at `0x8009C600` (11 per view) and y from four at
 * `0x800AE808`. All four layouts are transcribed below.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DEATH STRIPS THE ONE-PLAYER BAR — 0x80033C68
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The one-player hook calls the health sub-draw (`0x80033C40`) and the
 * current-weapon icon (`0x80033C50`) and only THEN tests the player's health:
 *
 *     80033C60  lh   v0, 264(s0)          s0 = the entity
 *     80033C68  blez v0, 0x80033CFC       zero or less -> the emitter setup
 *
 * The branch target is the `addiu a3, zero, 1` that arms the emitter's strip
 * flag, so it jumps past all five remaining sub-draws: the mega-health bleed
 * (`0x80033C70` -> 0x80037C20), ammo (`0x80033C94` -> 0x800352C0), armour
 * (`0x80033CB8` -> 0x80035554), the powerup timer (`0x80033CDC` -> 0x80035B38)
 * and the pickup caption (`0x80033CEC` -> 0x800359C0). Their fields keep the
 * 1 x 1 blank they were initialised to, and the emitter skips a 1 x 1 field
 * outright (`0x80035F5C`), so on death the bar is health, the weapon in hand
 * and the strip — nothing else.
 *
 * It is ONE-PLAYER ONLY. `q2psx-inspect access 0x108` finds entity+264 read in
 * this hook and inside the health sub-draw and NOWHERE in 0x80033D30,
 * 0x80034288 or 0x80034830, so a split viewport keeps its whole bar.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO weapon ids, not one — client+98 and client+102
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The bar reads BOTH, and they are different halfwords of the same 224-byte
 * client record. Collapsing them is why two of this cluster's findings read as
 * a contradiction when set side by side:
 *
 *     client+98   the weapon whose MODEL IS RAISED
 *                 0x800352E8 `lhu s0, 98(a3)` — the ammo count and the ammo
 *                 ICON key off it; 0x80037E78 gates the pickup auto-switch on
 *                 `+98 == 1`; 0x8004F970 commits viewweapon+214 into
 *                 viewweapon+212 and into +98 at the same instant, i.e. when
 *                 the new model finishes rising.
 *     client+102  the SELECTED weapon
 *                 0x80037CE8 `lh v1, 102(v1)` — field 12's icon; 0x80037EDC /
 *                 0x80037EEC — the carousel's two slots. 0x8003D5FC seeds +98
 *                 FROM +102 at spawn (in the JAL's delay slot) and
 *                 0x8003B188/0x8003B204 restores +102 from +98.
 *
 * So during a weapon raise retail shows the OLD weapon's ammo beside the NEW
 * weapon's icon in field 12. The port has ONE `combat.weapon_id`
 * (sim.h) and feeds it to both, so its two readouts switch on the same frame.
 * INFERRED, and only inferred: the divergence is as wide as the raise
 * animation. Nothing in the bar can settle how many frames that is — it needs
 * the view-weapon state machine — so the port's single id is recorded here as
 * a known simplification rather than modelled.

/*
 * CORRECTION — the bar indexes the rect table. It does not scan it.
 *
 * This block used to name item `effect` ids and resolve them through
 * `q2_icon_rect_for_id()`, on icontable.h's reading that a rect record's fifth
 * byte is the item's touch-dispatch index. The three sub-draws say otherwise,
 * in the plainest way a disassembly can:
 *
 *     80035190  lbu  v0, 170(t0)     t0 = 0x8009C478   health, ALWAYS 170
 *     80035374  sll  v0, a0, 2       a0 = ammoIcon[weapon]
 *     80035378  addu v0, v0, a0                        ammo,   a0 * 5
 *     80035380  addu v1, a0, t0                        &rect[a0]
 *
 * 170 is a byte offset into a five-byte record: rect 34. The ammo path
 * multiplies its table entry by five and adds the same base, so `ammoIcon[]`
 * is a rect index too. There is no strcmp, no scan, no compare of the fifth
 * byte anywhere in any of the three.
 *
 * WHAT THE OLD READING DREW, and why it looked plausible enough to ship:
 * scanning for effect 34 finds rect **30**, because rect 30's fifth byte
 * happens to be 34. So the health field drew a chunky machine-looking sprite
 * where retail shows a blue cross — and because it drew *something*
 * recognisable, it read as a mis-picked icon rather than as a whole mis-read
 * table. Rect 34 is the cross.
 *
 * The fifth byte is a PALETTE INDEX (see below), which is why joining it to
 * the item table produced a near-monotonic and therefore convincing-looking
 * correspondence. Two independent tells confirm the index reading against it:
 * the cell the effect reading assigns to rect 25 is EMPTY, and the cells the
 * index reading assigns to the six ammo types are six ammo boxes.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CORRECTION, the second one — THE ARMOUR ICON IS NOT ONE RECT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This block used to carry a third line beside the two above:
 *
 *     8003565C  lbu  v0, 150(a0)     a0 = 0x8009C478   armour, ALWAYS 150
 *
 * "ALWAYS" was the error, and it is the same shape as the one it replaced: the
 * instruction is real, the offset is real, and the premise that it is
 * unconditional was never tested. It is not. It sits inside ONE OF FIVE ARMS
 * of the armour sub-draw at `0x80035554`, and the arm is guarded by the POWER
 * SHIELD bit:
 *
 *     8003564C  andi v0, v0, 0x8000     Q2_INV_POWER_SHIELD
 *     80035650  beq  v0, zero, 0x800356E0
 *     8003565C  lbu  v0, 150(a0)        -> rect 30, the power shield
 *     8003576C  andi v1, v1, 0x4000     Q2_INV_ARMOUR_BODY
 *     8003577C  lbu  v0, 130(t0)        -> rect 26, the red vest
 *     80035800  andi v1, v1, 0x2000     Q2_INV_ARMOUR_COMBAT
 *     80035810  lbu  v0, 135(t0)        -> rect 27, the gold vest
 *     80035894  andi v1, v1, 0x1000     Q2_INV_ARMOUR_JACKET
 *     800358A4  lbu  v0, 140(t0)        -> rect 28, the grey vest
 *     80035928  (falls through)         -> rect 0, the blank
 *
 * The five-byte stride is proved inside the function rather than assumed: the
 * body arm reads 130, 131, then 132, 133, then `addiu v0, zero, 130 / addu
 * v0, v0, t0 / lbu v0, 4(v0)` = 134. Records run 130..134, 135..139, 140..144
 * and 150..154 — rects 26, 27, 28 and 30.
 *
 * Rendering those cells out of `qk_menu.lbm` with each rect's OWN palette (the
 * fifth byte: 31, 32, 33 and 34) settles what they are: 26/27/28 are three
 * armour vests in red, gold and grey, and 30 is a red-lamp device that is not
 * a vest at all. Reading 150 unconditionally therefore put the POWER SHIELD on
 * the bar for every player wearing any armour, which is the reported bug.
 *
 * The test order matters and is the console's: body, combat, jacket. A player
 * who has held body armour keeps 0x4000 up while wearing a weaker class, so
 * testing weakest-first would show the wrong vest.

 * They have their own position table and their own guards:
 *
 *     80036180  lh   v1, 96(s7)          slot A's rect index
 *     80036188  beq  v1, zero, skip      nothing selected, nothing drawn
 *     80036190  lh   v0, 100(s7)         slot B's
 *     80036198  beq  v1, v0, skip        the same weapon twice draws once
 *     800361A0  sll  a3, v1, 2
 *     800361A4  addu a3, a3, v1          index * 5, the rect stride again
 *     80036258  lh   v1, 100(s7)         then slot B, guarded only on zero
 *
 * `0x8009C658` is the head of the structure icontable.h records as "a
 * different structure that has not been identified" — it is this table, four
 * `s16` pairs read as consecutive halfwords (`tbl[fp]`, `tbl[fp+1]`):
 *
 *     (388, 201)  (458, 201)     one player
 *     (381,  95)  (419,  95)     a split viewport
 *
 * These are ABSOLUTE screen positions, not offsets from the bar's anchor —
 * and the y is 201, which is the one-player anchor's own row, so the strip
 * sits on the same line as the counters rather than being part of them.
 *
 * They are LEFT EDGES. The port used to subtract an icon width from them, on a
 * measurement rather than a read; the emitter settles it —
 *
 *     80033448  lhu  v0, 0(a1)      the table's x
 *     8003344C  lhu  v1, 4(a1)      the drawn w
 *     80033454  addu v0, v0, v1
 *     80033458  sh   v0, 20(a0)     -> vertex 1's x
 *
 * so x is the left edge and x + w the right. The three carousel cells then
 * tile the row: 388..420 (previous), 423..455 (field 12, the weapon in hand)
 * and 458..490 (next). The old capture measurement that made the strip look
 * right-anchored — ink at framebuffer columns 427..451, centre 439 — is
 * exactly centred on FIELD 12's cell, not on a strip slot, which is what it
 * would be with only a blaster held: the cycler returns 0 for both slots then
 * and the strip draws nothing at all.
 *
 * Its drawn size is the rect's OWN w and h, copied through with no
 * split-screen clamp (0x8003622C / 0x80036230 store sp+18 and sp+19, the rect
 * bytes 2 and 3, straight into the dest w/h). Only the one-player hook asks
 * for the strip — 0x80033CFC passes `a3 = 1` while 0x80034268, 0x80034810 and
 * 0x80034E4C all pass zero — so the second row of the table is dead data and
 * the missing clamp is unobservable, but it is transcribed as read.
 *
 * That still accounts for what capture shows — one icon with only the blaster
 * held, two once a second weapon is picked up — but by a different route than
 * this paragraph used to give. It said the one icon was a strip slot, drawn
 * once because the slots agreed. It is FIELD 12's: with only the blaster the
 * cycler returns zero for both slots and the strip draws nothing. With a
 * second, loaded weapon that weapon is both previous and next, slot A yields to
 * slot B (0x80036198), and the two icons are field 12 at 423 and slot B at
 * 458. A third weapon brings slot A in at 388.

     *     80037EE0  jal  0x80050758           a2 = 1, walk forwards
     *     80037EEC  lh   a1, 102(s0)
     *     80037EF4  jal  0x80050758           a2 = 0, walk backwards

     *     80037EFC  sh   v0, 96(s0)           +96 = PREVIOUS
     *
     * So slot A at x = 388 is client+96, the PREVIOUS weapon, and slot B at
     * x = 458 is client+100, the NEXT one. That the rect index IS the weapon id
     * is read rather than assumed too: 0x80037CF0 `sll a0, v1, 2` +
     * `addu a0, a0, v1` makes field 12's rect index out of the weapon id by the
     * same *5 stride, and the strip does it at 0x800361A0.
     *
     * SIX FUNCTIONS WRITE THEM, not four. This block used to name four, and the
     * two it missed are the two that SELECT a weapon. `q2psx-inspect access
     * 0x60` and `access 0x64` scan the whole image for those displacements; the
     * halfword stores into the client record are six pairs, each in the delay
     * slot of the second call to 0x80050758 and just after it:

     *     +100 / +96        in            on
     *     80037EB0 / EB4    0x80037E28    a weapon pickup (11 JAL callers)
     *     80037EF8 / EFC    0x80037ECC    an ammo pickup  (6 JAL callers)
     *     8003B220 / 224    0x8003B040    the ALL WEAPONS game variable

     *
     * and 0x80050758's thirteen JAL callers are those twelve plus 0x8004ED20,

     * ENTITY's contact normal (+152 is the move flags beside all three, and
     * 0x8003A578 puts 4096 in +98 between the two zeroes — the vector
     * (0, 4096, 0)); 0x80040760 is an ammo store at an index-scaled address in
     * the "PlayerSave0" block (a1 = that block + 16, 0x800406F0); 0x8006BB34
     * copies entity+704 into the block 0x8006B924 is handed in a2; 0x80098D78
     * walks an array in 0x80098C28's own table; the rest are word stores and
     * GPU packets (0x800AEDD4, 0x800B007C).
     *
     * WHEN THEY RUN is what makes the pair a latch rather than a formula.
     * Nothing else rewrites it, so between events it holds what the last one
     * saw:
     *
     *   - A POOL THAT FALLS WRITES NOTHING. A shot, or the power armour
     *     spending cells on a hit (0x80057BC8), can take a shared pool below
     *     a neighbour's one-shot minimum and leave the neighbour in its slot:
     *     the hyperblaster at 49 cells keeps the BFG (50) at 458, the shotgun
     *     at one shell keeps the super shotgun (2). It goes at the next
     *     event, which for an emptied gun is the dry trigger pull — the fire
     *     function returns 2 (the shotgun's on zero shells,
     *     0x8004C1FC-0x8004C21C), and 0x8004FB44 sends that, or the flag
     *     0x8004FEE8 raises at viewmodel+216 on the same result (0x80050230),
     *     to 0x800506C4 and the pair.
     *   - A WEAPON PICKUP WALKS BEFORE ITS AMMO IS ADDED. 0x80036410 calls
     *     0x80037E28, and only then does 0x80037DFC add the shells
     *     (0x80036444, stored at 0x80036458), so a gun picked up onto an
     *     empty pool stays out of the slots until the next event. The grenade
     *     box (0x80036A98) and the launcher's second call (0x800366D8) are
     *     the exceptions: each stores the grenades in that JAL's delay slot,
     *     so both walk with them in.
     *   - AN AMMO PICKUP WALKS AFTER: the pool is stored in 0x80037ECC's own
     *     delay slot (0x800369C4 for shells). The power shield calls it only
     *     when the cells were below the cap (0x80036DD8 branches past both).
     *   - THE BANDOLIER (0x8003701C-0x800370B0) AND THE AMMO PACK
     *     (0x80036F10-0x80037018) raise pools and write nothing: every JAL
     *     between those bounds is 0x80037DFC.
     *   - THE SELECT WRITES EVEN WHEN ITS STEP FINDS NOTHING: the delay slot
     *     of 0x8004ED3C sets a2 = 1 whatever 0x8004ED20 returned, and
     *     0x8004ED8C tests only a2.
     *   - 0x8003B040 WRITES ONLY UNDER ALL WEAPONS: 0x8003B070 branches to the
     *     epilogue unless bit 0x20 of 0x800B29EC (Q2_CHEAT_ALL_WEAPONS) is up.
     *
     * THE PORT. q2_statusbar_weapon_slots() below is the pair of calls, and
     * this array is the latch. Five of the six events exist here — the pickups
     * in item.c's touch dispatch, the spawn loadout, q2_sim_cycle_weapon and
     * q2_sim_autoselect_weapon — and the sixth does not: Q2_CHEAT_ALL_WEAPONS
     * is set by menu.c and tested nowhere (the cheat word's readers test
     * infinite ammo in item.c, one-shot kill in combat.c and no fall damage
     * in the client), so nothing grants what 0x8003B040 grants. A caller that
     * sees an event calls the writer there; the pickups happen inside the
     * sim, where a once-a-frame caller cannot see them, and
     * q2_statusbar_weapon_slots_track() infers those from what they leave.
     * Recomputing every frame instead is NOT what the console does, and shows
     * in the cases above: the falling pool, the pickup onto an empty pool, the
     * bandolier and the pack. 0x80050758's own gates are transcribed in
     * q2_weapon_cycle (weapon.c).

 *     console's two handlers do not;
 *   - an event that leaves nothing to see is missed: a select or auto-select
 *     that keeps the weapon, a weapon pickup onto a full pool, a spawn into
 *     the same loadout. The select, the auto-select and the spawn are the
 *     caller's own, and it should call q2_statusbar_weapon_slots at each;
