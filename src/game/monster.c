     * reports flat, with the drop trace returning 9 of 4096.

     * again onto correctly registered ground — about twelve steps to walk back
     * down. A corpse has no next step: the death moves' frame distances fall to
     * zero within a few frames, so it keeps whatever the last one gave it.
     * Suppressing the translation alone, with the hull untouched and the
     * animation still playing out in full, leaves the body on the floor for
     * the whole run — necessary and sufficient, established by counterfactual.

     * `m->corpse` is only raised once the module's own `*_dead` has run, which

     * tick. The console's dying body is still an edict and does still step; it
     * gets away with it because it does not have this port's hull
     * disagreement. So the rule here is "dead", not "detached", and what it
     * costs is the small forward lurch the death frames carry (115 units on

 * slot[+2] and the position, which is the first three words of the 80 bytes
 * copied out of obj+0x54 (0x8002085C reads them back at 0x80020984 and writes
 * them to the new item's +0xA4 and +0x54).
 *
 * slot[+4] is the multiplayer arm only: 0x80020DC4 tests 0x800AEBCC and, when
 * it is set, stores `lh (obj+0x0C)+0x66` — the client index — which 0x800206B8
 * then uses to index a byte table at 0x8009B510 instead of the class table.
 * Single player leaves it 0 and this port is single player, so the field is
 * named here and not carried.

 * 0x8007DA24/0x8007DA28), so this draw is taken from the one stream the
 * module's own random() draws come from, and it lands INSIDE the wrapper call:
 * after anything the module drew before calling it, before anything it draws
 * after. cre_insane.c's skin draw is the case that shows it.
 *
 * It reads what the module installed, which is why it cannot run in
 * q2_creature_spawn ahead of the module's spawn hook, where most of what this
 * port models of monster_start runs. The `sh` sits in the delay slot of `jal
 * 0x8007F474`, which hands the new frame to the render object; the port has no
 * render object, so that call has no counterpart here.
