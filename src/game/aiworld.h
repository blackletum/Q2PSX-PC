/*
 * aiworld.h — binding the creature AI to the real collision model.
 *
 * The AI asks the world three questions and nothing else: can this creature
 * see that one, where does a box move end up, and is there ground under my
 * feet. `ai.h` takes those as function pointers so the behaviour can be
 * exercised without a disc; this is the implementation that answers them out
 * of a level's own hull.
 *
 * The three map onto routines the original already has, which is why the
 * binding is thin rather than a reimplementation:
 *
 *   line_of_sight   `visible` (0x8005B950) ends in a swept move through the
 *                   collision graph at 0x80044C44 against PrimaryColl
 *                   (0x800C8E90) — `q2_coll_move` here.
 *   trace           the same walk, but against the OTHER hull; see below.
 *   check_bottom    M_CheckBottom (0x8005FB24) — FOUR corner sweeps, not one
 *                   probe under the centre.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHICH HULL, and the two mistakes that came of getting it wrong
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This header used to say the AI's mins/maxs are "advisory", because
 * SecondaryCol is PrimaryColl already eroded by the mover's box. The design
 * statement was right and the WIRING contradicted it: bound_trace discarded the
 * box it was handed and swept a bare point through PrimaryColl, the UN-eroded
 * hull. A creature's centre was therefore allowed to travel until the CENTRE
 * touched the wall, i.e. up to its own half-extent embedded in it.
 *
 * The original picks per call. 0x8005BD3C compares the caller's mins and maxs
 * against the shared zero vector at 0x8009FBE4 and branches:
 *
 *     0x8005BE4C  addiu s0, 0x800C8FE8   SecondaryCol, when the box is real
 *     0x8005BEB8  addiu s0, 0x800C8E90   PrimaryColl,  when it is zero or NULL
 *
 * and SV_movestep (0x8005FC78) always passes a real box — 0x8005CCF4 fills it
 * from obj+0x6C..0x76 before the call — so a walking creature is a BOX in the
 * eroded hull. Sight and the ground probe pass no box and stay on PrimaryColl.
 *
 * The second mistake is what made the first one look right. A Population spawn
 * record's Y is the FEET, and every consumer here treats the creature's `pos`
 * as the entity ORIGIN, 286 above them (worldscale.h's Q2_EYE_BASE; the same
 * lift sim.c already applies to the player and item.c to an item). With the
 * feet value fed to the eroded hull, 214 of 214 creatures resolved to no cell
 * at all — a measurement that was sound, was recorded, and answered the wrong
 * question. Lifted, 21 of 22 in-zone spawn records on four maps are inside
 * SecondaryCol. The two changes are only correct together.
 *
 * A creature whose zone has no collision loaded falls back to the open world,
 * which is the same failure the stand-in has and is visible rather than silent.
