/*
 * multiplayer.h — the multiplayer runtime, reconstructed from QMULTI.C.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Where the multiplayer game actually lives
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Not in the executable. Two earlier passes swept SLES_015.34 for a deathmatch
 * scoring function and found nothing, and the sweep was right: the executable
 * carries the *hook*, not the rules. The player-death handler at `0x800396AC`
 * ends with
 *
 *     if (multiplayer && killer < 4 && victim < 4)
 *         (*(0x800B2F58))->[4](killer, victim);
 *
 * and `0x800B2F58` is the map's own relocatable `LevelBin` module, installed by
 * `0x8007A330`. So the whole of deathmatch is a per-map module — and the module
 * names itself, because its debug string is `"QMULTI.C : LEVEL IS %s\n"`.
 *
 * The module is 5,608 bytes and, checked disc-wide, is **byte-identical on all
 * thirteen arenas** after relocation (MATRIX1…MATRIX9, THEVAT, TIMS, PODCITY,
 * FRAGTOWE). One QMULTI.C, compiled once, stamped into each. Every other map on
 * the disc has a different LevelBin and no multiplayer spawn points, and the two
 * facts partition the disc identically — see `q2psx-inspect multi`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * How the module reaches the engine
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `0x8007A330` writes `0x800B2FE4` into the module header at `+0x08`, and that
 * one pointer is both the engine's exported API and the shared session state:
 * `0x80079818` fills it with function and data pointers, and the settings the
 * menu already documents (`GRAVITY` at `0x800B335A`, and so on) sit in the same
 * block a little higher up. That is why the session variables below are given as
 * offsets from `0x800B2FE4` as well as absolute addresses — they are the same
 * struct the menu writes to.
 *
 * The slots QMULTI.C uses, read out of the table builder. FORMATS.md §15 counts
 * the same block in slots rather than bytes, so both are given:
 *
 *     +0x004   1  0x8008A4D8   printf (debug only)
 *     +0x024   9  0x80056C60   spawn a named Population batch
 *     +0x028  10  0x80056F8C   select the named Population group
 *     +0x030  12  0x8003DDF8   place player i at a MultiSpawn  (see below)
 *     +0x064  25  &0x800B2D8C  slot for the per-frame level hook
 *     +0x078  30  &0x800B2A24  the team/flag enable — see the note on cut modes
 *     +0x0D4  53  &0x800B2DB4  the frame's dt
 *     +0x0D8  54  &0x800B2C2C  the active player count
 *     +0x0EC  59  &0x800AEBAC  the level clock, in dt units
 *     +0x104  65  0x800D5C30   the player array, stride 784
 *     +0x110  68  0x800894B8   sprintf
 *     +0x1E4 121  0x8001A384   menu page-enter — called with page 45
 *     +0x200 128  0x8001A474   menu item-table loader
 *     +0x20C 131  0x80019B88   the menu engine's tick
 *     +0x3AC 235  &0x800B2E28  the engine's game-state request word
 *
 * The order of the two Population calls is what tells them apart: init passes
 * the GROUP name "MultiBatches" through slot 10 once, and then each BATCH name
 * through slot 9. Slot 10's own body copies its 12-byte argument into a global
 * at 0x800D4AE8, which is what a selection does and what a spawn does not.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The session variables
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *     0x800B334E   E+874   time limit, MINUTES, -1 for none
 *     0x800B3350   E+876   frag limit, -1 for none
 *     0x800B3352   E+878   round limit
 *     0x800B3354   E+880   game mode
 *     0x800B3356   E+882   player count
 *     0x800B3498   E+1204  s16 frags[4]
 *     0x800B34A0   E+1212  s16 team_frags[4]   (round wins in VERSUS)
 *     0x800B34A8   E+1220  s16 kills[4][4]
 *
 * Nothing in the executable writes the mode, the limits or the score arrays:
 * `QFRONT`'s own LevelBin does, which is why an EXE-only search for them fails.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Six modes, three of them reachable
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * QMULTI.C branches on six mode values and `QMRESULT`'s LevelBin carries six
 * scoreboard titles in the same order — `DM SCORES`, `TEAM DM SCORES`,
 * `CTF SCORES`, `TAG SCORES`, `TEAM TAG SCORES`, `VERSUS SCORES` — so the
 * numbering is not inferred, it is spelled out twice.
 *
 * But the front end's mode selector at `0x8010459C` writes exactly three values,
 * 0, 1 and 5, and offers exactly three labels. CTF, TAG and TEAM TAG are built,
 * described in the rules text, given scoreboard titles and given item batches,
 * and cannot be chosen. Two further pieces of evidence say the same thing:
 * QMULTI.C's init does `*(E->[0x78]) = 0` and then immediately branches on
 * `*(E->[0x78])`, so the flag/team setup that follows is unreachable; and no
 * arena on the disc carries a `RedFlag` or `BlueFlag` batch to spawn.
 *
 * This module implements all six, because the rules for the three cut ones are
 * as well established as the rules for the three shipped ones, and marks which
 * is which so a caller cannot accidentally present a cut mode as original
 * behaviour.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is NOT reconstructed here
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The flag entity itself. CTF/TAG/TEAM TAG spawn `RedFlag`/`BlueFlag` batches
 * and score through a path this module never sees, because the shipped arenas
 * contain no flags and the code that would have run is dead. Their scoring is
 * therefore left unimplemented rather than guessed: `q2_mp_player_killed` does
 * for modes 2..4 exactly what the original does, which is nothing.
