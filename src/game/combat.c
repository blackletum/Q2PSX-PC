     * are not followed by a hit — q2_sim_fire does one per shot, and the
     * owner's own splash does one per detonation, in range or not. A Soldier's
     * kill (byte 4) followed by the player's rocket bursting far away came out
     * of the refresh as q2_actor_init's old seed, -1, and cried out, and in
     * deathmatch charged a suicide, where the console is silent and scores
     * nothing. A lava death that met a refresh lost its mod 10 the same way.
     * All three are carried as `owner` and `env_next` are.
     *
     * They are NOT re-seeded here on a respawn, and that is the caller's job.
     * 0x8003DDF8 builds the new body from a FRESH entity — 0x8003B250 allocates

     * respawn is `q2_actor_init` followed by this, not this alone.

     * of a literal -1 is 0x800396DC, inside the death handler and only for mods
     * 9 and 10. What 0x80057D54 writes is an index: the attacker's client index
     * in deathmatch (0x80057E04), the attacker's own +222 byte when it has no
     * client (0x80057E68), or `(attacker - 0x800CBA28) / 768` in single player
     * (0x80057E88..0x80057EB8) — a chain I evaluated rather than assumed, and
     * with a NULL attacker it yields -2797289, whose low byte 0x17 makes the
     * `sb` store 23.
     *
     * So "-1 means the world" was a port convention with no instruction behind
     * it, and it fed a death voice that then cried out for every crusher, every
     * Soldier and every scripted hazard.
     *
     * SINGLE PLAYER is one arm, 0x80057E88..0x80057EB8, and it always stores.
     * The pool slot it computes is not modelled. `access 0xDE` over the whole
     * image finds four reads: this function's three of the ATTACKER's byte
     * (0x80057E54/0x80057E58, the deathmatch copy arm below, and 0x80057F38,
     * the knockback's self test, which `apply_knockback` answers by identity
     * instead) and the death handler's 0x800396EC. In single player that last
     * one only asks whether the byte is -1 (0x80039728; the frag hook sits
     * behind 0x80039764's deathmatch test), and any other value answers it the
     * same way. So a client attacker's `owner` and, for anything else,
     * Q2_MP_NOT_A_PLAYER (4) — what the projectile spawners store for an owner
     * with no client block (0x8004A208, 0x8004ABF4, 0x8004B1C4, 0x8004BF80) —
     * stand in for the slot index and for the 23 a NULL attacker makes.
     *
     * DEATHMATCH has five arms, and two of them store nothing:
     *
     *     80057DB8  bne   s5, zero, 0x80057E04   ; an attacker -> its arms
     *     80057DC0  beq   s0, zero, 0x80057EBC   ; no target client: NO STORE
     *     80057DC8  addiu v1, v1, 31840          ; 0x800C7C60, the client base
     *     80057DCC  subu  v1, s0, v1             ; the TARGET's client block...
     *       ...                                  ; ...times the inverse of 7,
     *     80057E00  sra   v0, v0, 5              ; >> 5: / 224, the client stride
     *     80057E04  lw    v0, 12(s5)             ; the attacker's client block
     *     80057E0C  beq   v0, zero, 0x80057E50   ; none -> the copy arm
     *     80057E48  j     0x80057EB8             ; its index, the same divide
     *     80057E54  lb    v0, 222(s5)            ; the ATTACKER's own byte
     *     80057E5C  beq   v0, v1, 0x80057E6C     ; v1 = 4 (0x80057E50): print,
     *                                            ; and NO STORE
     *     80057E68  sb    a0, 222(s2)            ; otherwise hand it on
     *     80057EB8  sb    v0, 222(s2)
     *
     * s0 is the target's client (0x80057D94), so a NULL attacker credits the
     * player it hurt with their OWN index — the same divide 0x800396E0 uses for
     * the victim. A crusher (0x80051E74) or a scripted hit (0x80027858) that
     * kills in deathmatch therefore reaches 0x80039774 with killer == victim:
     * it passes `slti s1, 4`, the hook is called, and the module charges a
     * suicide. It does not cry out, because the byte is not -1. `owner` is this
     * port's name for a client's index (combat.h); a client actor without one
     * records 4.
     *
     * The copy arm is how a creature's kill is scored: the creature's own byte
     * is whoever last hurt IT (0x80057E04 wrote a player's index there when a
     * player shot it), so a creature that kills player A after player B shot
     * it hands B the frag. A creature nobody has hurt holds 4 here —
     * `q2_actor_init`'s seed — and takes the "can't determine which player hit
     * other player" arm (0x800ACD9C through the hook at 0x800B2FE8, not
     * reproduced), which leaves the victim's byte as it was. INFERRED, and a
     * known difference: the console's creature holds 0 until it is first hurt,
     * because nothing in `access 0xDE` writes a fresh creature's byte and the
     * pool allocator clears the entity (0x8006C18C `jal 0x80089E18`, 768
     * bytes), which would copy a 0 and hand player 0 the frag.
     *
     * Leaving the byte UNWRITTEN only means something because the two
     * refreshes now carry it (q2_actor_from_player, q2_actor_from_monster).
     * `last_mod` has no such arms: 0x80057E84 and 0x80057EBC store +223 on
     * every path, and it was written above.
