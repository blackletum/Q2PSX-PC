/*
 * spawn.h — placing creatures in a level from the Population records.
 *
 * The last link in the chain. Population's spawn list gives a position, an
 * angle and a class_id; the class_id indexes the engine's 38-entry module
 * registry; the module holds that creature's AI. So a spawn record plus a
 * relocated module is a live monster.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why class_id can be trusted
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It was an open question for a long time: 25 distinct values in 0..37 whose
 * meaning was unknown, and which demonstrably was NOT a ModelNames index (15 of
 * 673 records exceeded the map's name count, and resolving them by name gave
 * nonsense).
 *
 * The registry settles it. The engine stores each loaded module into a table
 * indexed by the instance's class id, and that table has exactly 38 slots —
 * the same range the spawn records use, bound-checked at the read site. Two
 * independent numbers agreeing at 38 is what makes this a link rather than a
 * coincidence.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What a spawned creature can and cannot do
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It exists, occupies a position, faces a direction, has health, can be shot
 * and killed — and it now runs the engine's AI: it notices the player, turns,
 * chases through the level, remembers where it last saw you and hunts down
 * your trail. All of that is engine code and is reconstructed in `ai.[ch]`.
 *
 * Its ANIMATIONS come from its own module: `creature.[ch]` follows the
 * module's code to its moves and frames and `crebind.[ch]` hands them to the
 * frame driver, so a creature plays the right walk cycle and the right death
 * without any of it being transcribed.
 *
 * What is still per-creature code is the body of each think function — the
 * shot, the sound, the claw. The Soldier's are written; the other six modules
 * run on the generic implementation, which animates and chases correctly and
 * performs no per-frame action. So a Tank Commander will hunt you down and
 * swing at you without ever firing, which is a visible partial rather than a
 * hidden one.
 *
 * q2_spawn_stats reports how many were placed and how many had no module,
 * because the difference between "no monsters here" and "monsters we could
 * not resolve" is worth being able to see.
