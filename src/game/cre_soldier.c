/*
 * cre_soldier.c — the Soldier, transcribed from its own module.
 *
 * The Soldier ships on seven of the disc's thirteen AI maps — BASE0 through
 * BASE3, JAIL5, MAGDEMO and WASTE1 — which makes it most of the monsters in
 * the game. Its module is `BASE1 CreAIBin` module 0, 13,164 bytes relocated,
 * and every address below is inside it at a base of 0x80100000.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It is PC Quake II's soldier, line for line
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every function decoded lands on id's own source, and several of them do so
 * on constants that were not tuned to produce the match:
 *
 *   soldier_stand          module+0x19A0  `random() < 0.8`  as 26214/32768
 *   soldier_idle           module+0x1A0C  `random() > 0.8`  as 26215/32768
 *   soldier_walk1_random   module+0x1AA0  `random() > 0.1`  as  3278/32768
 *   soldier_fire           module+0x1120  three flash tables chosen by skinnum
 *   soldier_duck_down      module+0x1E64  `pausetime = level.time + 1 s`
 *   soldier_attack3_refire module+0x1F6C  `level.time + 0.4 < pausetime`
 *   soldier_dead           module+0x20F0  movetype TOSS, SVF_DEADMONSTER
 *   soldier_pain           module+0x1028  `velocity[2] > 100` as < -1200
 *   soldier_die            module+0x2318  `health <= gib_health`, gib_health -30
 *
 * The spawn function (module+0x1604, export 0) writes exactly id's SET of
 * callbacks — pain +0xA0, die +0xA4, stand +0xE0, walk +0xEC, run +0xF0,
 * dodge +0xF4, sight +0x100, attack +0xF8, listed in the order the module
 * stores them rather than the order id's source assigns them — with
 * `melee` (+0xFC) explicitly zeroed because a soldier has none; sets `mass = 100`
 * (entity+0x4E) and the animation speed scale to 12 (entity+0x13B);
 * packs `solid = SOLID_BBOX` and
 * `movetype = MOVETYPE_STEP` into entity+0x20; links the entity twice through
 * import +0x1C; calls its own stand callback; calls walkmonster_start
 * (import +0xFC); and only then writes the variant's `skinnum` — +0x1754,
 * +0x1860 or +0x1960, one per arm — followed by the tail all three arms share,
 * `health` at module+0x1968 and `gib_health = -30` at +0x1974.
 *
 * `soldier_spawn` at the bottom of this file is everything in that list the
 * framework does not already do, and it exists because `q2_creature_spawn`
 * CALLS `impl->spawn` now. It did not when this file was written, and the
 * sentence that used to stand here — "so this file installs no `spawn` hook" —
 * is withdrawn. The callbacks, the speed scale and the two links stay the
 * framework's; mass, solid, movetype, skinnum, health and the stand call are
 * the module's own stores and are made there.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The three soldiers are one creature with three skins
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `skinnum` (entity+0x3A) selects both the weapon and the variant, and the
 * class table's three Soldier rows carry the health that goes with each:
 *
 *     skinnum 0..1   blaster      class 19, health 20   (light guard)
 *     skinnum 2..3   shotgun      class 18, health 30   (shotgun guard)
 *     skinnum 4+     machinegun   class 20, health 40   (machinegun guard)
 *
 * Those are PC Quake II's own figures, creature for creature. A row the module
 * does not know is not a fourth variant: module+0x1654 falls through to
 * `printf("Unknown soldier type\r\n")` at module+0x2B4 and installs NOTHING —
 * no callbacks, no health. See `soldier_skin` for what this port does instead.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE DODGE IS EMPTY, and two whole animations fall off the disc with it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The spawn function does install a dodge — module+0x22F0 into entity+0xF4 at
 * module+0x16C0 — and module+0x22F0 is two instructions, `jr ra` and a
 * delay-slot nop. So this is not a gap in the port: the console's Soldier
 * cannot dodge, because its module ships a handler that returns.
 *
 * That one cut explains everything else the census flags as unreachable. id's
 * `soldier_dodge` is the only thing that installs `soldier_move_duck` and
 * `soldier_move_attack3`, so on this disc:
 *
 *   Duck 45-49 (module+0x2F68) — a real mmove with real frames and
 *   `soldier_run` as its endfunc, which nothing installs. Its thinks 12, 19
 *   and 13 are duck_down / duck_hold / duck_up.
 *
 *   Attack3 30-38 (module+0x2EE8) — likewise a real mmove, and part of the
 *   answer to the census's "module names 6 ranges no decoded move claims":
 *   THREE of those six lie inside it, namely 30-31 (labelled "Death6"),
 *   32-35 "Fire 3 Aim" and 36-38 "Fire 3 Shoot". The other three — 0-0 "Run",
 *   12-14 "Fire 1 Done" and 215-224 "Fire 2 Done" — are not Attack3's and are
 *   still unexplained. Nine frames of ai_charge 0 with thinks 14, 15, 13 at
 *   frames 32, 35 and 36, endfunc `soldier_run` — id's `soldier_move_attack3`
 *   frame for frame. Read out of the record itself: module+0x2EE8 is
 *   {30, 38, frames module+0x2ECC, endfunc module+0x1ADC} and the 27 bytes at
 *   module+0x2ECC are nine {ai 4, dist 0, think} triples with 14, 15 and 13 in
 *   slots 2, 5 and 6. The model still carries "Fire 3 Aim" and
 *   "Fire 3 Shoot" for it; nothing plays them.
 *
 * All five of those think functions are transcribed below anyway, and
 * registered in the method table, because the module registers them: it builds
 * 23 methods at module+0x32E8 and hands the whole table to all three class
 * bytes. A table with holes where the module has entries would say the port
 * failed to read them.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Sounds — thirteen handles, and the module names every one
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The module carries two tables sharing one index: thirteen resolved handles
 * at `module+0x32A0` on a 4-byte stride, and thirteen 12-byte NAME fields at
 * `module+0x1D0`. The handles are zero on disc because the engine fills them
 * at load; the names are on the disc, and each registration call was followed
 * from the bytes it packs to the slot it stores:
 *
 *     +0x32A0  sol_idle1     +0x32B8  sol_deth1    +0x32C8  msc_udeath
 *     +0x32A4  sol_sght1     +0x32BC  sol_deth2    +0x32CC  wep_machgf1b
 *     +0x32A8  sol_sght1     +0x32C0  sol_deth3    +0x32D0  wep_shotgf1b
 *     +0x32AC  sol_pain1     +0x32C4  wep_shotgr1b / wep_sshotr1b
 *     +0x32B0  sol_pain2
 *     +0x32B4  sol_pain3
 *
 * +0x32A8 really is `sol_sght1` a second time: the calls at module+0x690 and
 * module+0x6F8 pack the same twelve bytes of module+0x1DC, the second one out
 * of registers the first spilled to the stack. id has `sound_sight1` =
 * solsght1 and `sound_sight2` = solsrch1, and this disc ships no search sound,
 * so the second slot gets the first's name.
 *
 * AND THE HANDLES FALL BACK ON EACH OTHER. module+0xE50..+0xF28 runs the same
 * shape twice, once over the pain trio and once over the death trio:
 *
 *     h = pain2 ? pain2 : (pain1 ? pain1 : pain3);
 *     if (!pain1) pain1 = h;  if (!pain2) pain2 = h;  if (!pain3) pain3 = h;
 *
 * import +0x24 returns 0 for a name the map's bank does not carry, so a map
 * shipping only one of the three plays that one for all three. module+0xD9C is
 * the same idea in one step: register `wep_shotgr1b`, and only if that comes
 * back zero register `wep_sshotr1b` into the same slot.
 *
 * WHAT THE MODULE ACTUALLY PLAYS is four of the thirteen, all unconditional —
 * the PSX dropped id's skinnum-selected pain and death voices:
 *
 *     module+0x1A44  think 2   +0x32A0  sol_idle1
 *     module+0x1A78  think 3   +0x32C4  wep_shotgr1b   (the cock)
 *     module+0x2250  sight     +0x32A4  sol_sght1
 *     module+0x1078  pain      +0x32B4  sol_pain3
 *     module+0x23D0  die       +0x32C0  sol_deth3
 *
 * plus +0x32D0 and +0x32CC inside `soldier_fire`. `msc_udeath` is registered
 * and NO instruction loads it, so a Soldier's gib is silent as far as its own
 * module is concerned; the sound belongs to whatever the engine runs on the
 * corpse (import +0x11C).
 *
 * THE INDEX BELOW IS THE PORT'S, NOT THE MODULE'S. `q2_cre_soldier_sound_name`
 * is called from `client/main.c` with a literal 8 and 9 for the two fire
 * sounds, so slots 0..10 are frozen where they were and the two names that
 * were missing are appended at 11 and 12. The module's own slot is written
 * beside every entry.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Frame numbers are the animation's identity
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Moves are looked up by their first frame rather than by position, so the
 * constants below are the disc's own frame numbering and can be checked
 * against `q2psx-inspect creatures` directly.

 *
 * and `q2psx-inspect classes` confirms rows 18/19/20 carry health 30/20/40.

 * handler's low bit on top. Both read the class row, so the stored field and

 *                                          from the creature record's scale
 *     mass        = 100         ; +0x1678  entity+0x4E

 *     skinnum, health           ; +0x1754/+0x175C per arm, stored at +0x1968
 *     gib_health  = -30         ; +0x196C, +0x1974  entity+0x52
 *
 * AND THE TAIL IS AFTER walkmonster_start FOR A REASON. Import 58 is
 * 0x80062240, which parks a think on entity+0x94 (0x8006241C) and `jal`s
 * `monster_start` at 0x800619E0. That function ZEROES skinnum — `sh zero,
 * 58(s0)` at 0x80061AFC — and takes `max_health` from whatever health the
 * entity carries at that moment (0x80061B00). So the module writes its skinnum
 * and its health afterwards deliberately, and `max_health` ends up the row's
 * rather than the module's. The port's `q2_creature_spawn` stands in for
 * `monster_start` and runs before this hook, so the same order holds.
 *
 * MASS, MOVETYPE AND SOLID were dropped by the first pass because the port had
 * nowhere to put them. It has all three now (monster.h), and `mass` is written
 * HERE rather than left to the framework: `q2_creature` decodes it per module
 * and `q2_creature_spawn` still does not copy it onto the entity, so this is
 * the only store that reaches the field.
 *
 * HEALTH is the loader's figure and the module's, and they agree row for row —
 * the class table carries 30/20/40 and -30 for rows 18/19/20 and `creworld.c`
 * applies them before this runs, which is the loader's own order (0x8007E68C
 * and 0x8007E698 write health, 0x8007E6AC then calls export 0). So these
 * stores change nothing today. They are made anyway because the module makes
 * them, and because the order means a module that disagreed with its row would
 * win. `max_health` (entity+0x50) is NOT among them: no arm writes it, the
 * loader's pass is what sets it, and `soldier_pain` reads it back at
 * module+0xFBC.
 *
 * THE UNKNOWN ROW writes nothing at all — module+0x1978 prints "Unknown
 * soldier type" and returns, no callbacks, no health, no skinnum. That refusal
 * cannot be reproduced from here for the reason `soldier_skin` gives: the
 * binder has already spawned the creature by the time this runs. The shared
 * stores are made for it and `health` is left as the class row gave it, which
