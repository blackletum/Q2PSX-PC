/*
 * entitydraw.h — putting the entity set into the ordering table.
 *
 * modeldraw.c draws ONE model instance. This walks a whole entity set, resolves
 * each entity's model out of the map's CastList, applies the state its think
 * left behind — the spin, the materialise intensity, the glow — and appends
 * the lot to the same ordering table the world was built into.
 *
 * That last part is why this is a separate module and not something the client
 * does inline: the primitives have to land in the SAME table as the world
 * geometry, or the sort cannot interleave an item with the crate it sits behind.
 * The original has exactly one table per frame and so does this.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is faithful here and what is not
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FAITHFUL: +0xFC/+0xFE reach the GPU through the GTE light matrix and back
 * colour (`0x8006B298`, `0x8006B468`) without changing geometry; the yaw is
 * the entity's own +0xE8 on the 4096-step circle; the origin is +0xA4, which
 * the spawner already biased by 286 and the model's own offset.
 *
 * NOT YET: the sparkle particles the materialise ramp emits. The translucent
 * floor shadow is reconstructed from the item table's posed-vertex list and
 * the real 16x16 tile/palette in `chars.lbm` / the executable palette bank.
 * An item that has not finished materialising therefore brightens through the
 * decoded lighting ramp and casts its retail shadow, but has no sparkles yet.

 * have its heading turned the wrong way. The explicit matrix is RotMatrix's

 *               `jal 0x8006FC1C` each, 0x8004D848 through 0x8004D8B8.
 *   0x80047F44  `andi v0, v0, 0x4` — the same bit of the same halfword, and
 *               the per-view arm behind it is the reader: 0x80048088 `lwc2`
 *               the corners in three `rtpt` batches (corner 5 projected twice,
 *               into the same slot), 0x8004813C `swc2 SZ3` for the sort depth.
 *   0x80048160  `jal 0x800B1E28(0x8009D664, 0x8009D6C8, sp+40, [0x800B2744])`
 *               — the emitter, over the six-face table (weapontables.h).
 *   0x80048194  `jal 0x80064FAC` links the result into the ordering table.
 *
 * So the geometry is the disc's, the orientation is the disc's, and so is the
 * decision to draw it. The colour is NOT 0x800AE954 — that preset is read only
 * by the two dynamic-light arms at 0x800481CC and 0x80048244. A bolt's body
 * carries its own four colours per face, in the GPU header words of
 * 0x8009D664, and it is opaque.
 *
 * AND A BLASTER BOLT HAS NO BODY. Bit 0x4 is clear in the 11 the blaster
 * passes and set in the 14 the hyperblaster passes, so one is this box and the
 * other is the particle trail bit 0x1 gives it instead (effect.h). The two are
 * mutually exclusive across all three callers of 0x8004D70C.
