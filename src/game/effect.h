 * effect.h — the presentation layer: particles, beams, debris and glints.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Four machines, not one
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * There is no generic "effect" in this engine. What looks like one system is
 * four, with different pools, different lifetimes and different renderers.
 * `src/build/fxtables.h` owns their data; this owns their behaviour.
 *
 *   GROUPS   0x80030284, updated and drawn by 0x800304A8.
 *            Up to fifteen screen-aligned quads sharing one origin, one
 *            velocity, one acceleration and a pair of colour ramps. Every
 *            spark, blood spray, explosion flame and gib puff in the game is
 *            this, differing only in ramp, size and lifetime.
 *
 *   BEAMS    0x80064E64, drawn and reset by 0x80064F10.
 *            A 32-slot pool that is refilled from empty EVERY frame. A beam is
 *            a hexagonal tube between two points with two end caps; the twelve
 *            hull vertices are generated at draw time from the beam's own
 *            direction, so the pool stores only the endpoints and a radius.
 *
 *            Behind it sits a TIMED list of twelve (0x800CABC0), whose entries
 *            outlive the frame and are re-submitted until their timers expire.
 *            That is the BFG's beam — the game's weapon trail. See below.
 *
 *   DEBRIS   0x80064558 spawns a burst, 0x80064398 spawns one piece,
 *            0x80064124 thinks. Real entities with physics and a lifetime.
 *
 *   GLINTS   0x80064C00 / 0x80064780.
 *            A faceted body attached to an entity carrying flag 0x04000000,
 *            with a bright band sweeping across its surface.
 *
 *            THIS IS NOT A WEAPON TRAIL. The obvious reading of "a mesh dragged
 *            behind an entity with a band running along it" is a trail, and it
 *            is wrong: the mesh is the `GlintMod` level chunk, and drawing
 *            BIGGUN's — the only one on the disc — puts a 216-quad SPHERE on
 *            screen, not a ribbon. The band sweeps its surface, which is a
 *            shimmer. It is also not the game's weapon trail — the BFG's beam
 *            is, and that lives in the timed list above.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The group pool is not a particle pool
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A slot is a whole burst, not one particle, and this is load-bearing: the
 * fifteen quads in a group cannot outlive each other, cannot be culled
 * separately, and all read the same ramp entry, so a burst fades as one object.
 * That is why the original's explosions pulse rather than dissolve.
 *
 * Particle 0 carries the group's absolute position and velocity. Particles
 * 1..14 carry an offset and a velocity RELATIVE to particle 0, which is why the
 * whole burst drifts together while spreading — and why the spawner subtracts
 * `vel[0]` from every other velocity before storing it (0x800303C8).
 *
 * The record's field order is preserved here because the offsets are how the
 * layout was established:
 *
 *     +0x00  s32 origin[3]        particle 0, absolute
 *     +0x0C  s16 offset[14][3]    particles 1..14, relative to particle 0
 *     +0x60  s16 accel[3]         added to vel each tick; zeroed by the SPAWNER
 *     +0x66  s16 vel[3]           particle 0, absolute
 *     +0x6C  s16 rel_vel[14][3]   particles 1..14, relative to particle 0
 *     +0xC0  s16 size             world size, scaled by [0x800D5D46] at spawn
 *     +0xC4  u8  view_mask        high nibble: skip this group in viewport n
 *     +0xC5  u8  life             0 means the slot is free
 *     +0xC6  u8  count
 *     +0xC7  u8  area             visibility key, from the area record's +0x20
 *     +0xC8  ramp[0], +0xCC ramp[1]
 *
 * The accel slot sits inside what would otherwise be a fifteenth offset, which
 * is exactly why the burst is capped at fifteen quads and not sixteen.
 *
 * "ALWAYS ZERO at spawn" used to be stated here as a property of the EFFECT.
 * It is a property of the SPAWNER — 0x800301F0 and 0x8003040C memset it — and
 * four call sites overwrite it the instant the spawner returns:
 *
 *     0x8003E0D4  sh v0(=4), 98(v1)     the spark
 *     0x80048C1C  sh v0(=2), 98(v1)     the blood spray
 *     0x80049088  sh v0(=2), 98(v1)     the laser end, first site
 *     0x80049134  sh v0(=2), 98(v1)     the laser end, second site
 *
 * 98 = 0x62 = accel[1], and every one of the four is guarded on the spawner's
 * return value being non-null. So sparks, blood and laser ends SAG; taking the
 * comment at face value made them drift in a straight line forever.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * There are THREE spawners, not one
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This header used to say the engine has one group spawner. It has three, and
 * they differ in their argument lists rather than in what they build:
 *
 *     0x80030284   8 call sites   velocities only; every burst starts at a point
 *     0x8003004C   6 call sites   velocities AND a fifteen-entry OFFSET array,
 *                                 stored as offset[i-1] = offs[i] >> 4, so the
 *                                 burst starts already scattered
 *     0x8002FDFC   6 call sites   an array of ABSOLUTE WORLD POINTS at stride
 *                                 12 instead of one origin — the caller hands
 *                                 it a point per quad and it turns points
 *                                 1..count-1 into offsets itself
 *
 * All three are modelled now. The bullet's world impact is a 0x8003004C site
 * (0x80048AC4) and its absence is why a bullet hitting a wall used to raise the
 * PLAYER-STATE spark — ramp 0, pure blue — instead of a grey smoke puff.
 *
 * THE THIRD ONE'S DISTINGUISHING FEATURE is not "an interleaved record", which
 * is what this header used to guess. It is that the CALLER supplies absolute
 * world points, which is what lets the five mesh drawers below sample vertices
 * off a posed model and hand the results straight in. And the difference from
 * 0x8003004C is one instruction wide and load-bearing:
 *
 *     0x8002FF44  subu v0, v0, v1     0x80030174  sll 16 / sra 20
 *     0x8002FF48  sh   v0, 12(a0)
 *
 * — the third spawner stores the raw 16-bit difference with NO >>4, so a mesh
 * sampled at world scale keeps its shape. Shifting here would collapse a
 * soldier's crackle into a point.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two ramps, alternating in threes
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The renderer swaps its two ramps every three quads (0x80030A14), so a group
 * given two different ramps stripes them 3-3-3-3-3 rather than blending. Every
 * spawner on the disc but one passes the same pointer twice; the blood spray
 * (0x80048BFC) is the exception, and it is why blood has two tones.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Age indexes the ramp, so lifetime IS colour
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `colour = ramp[32 - life]`. Life counts down from what the spawner asked for,
 * so a 15-tick group only ever uses entries 17..31 — the dim tail. Changing a
 * lifetime changes the colour the effect starts at. See fxtables.h.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is READ and what is MODELLED
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * READ from the executable: the record layout and every offset in it; the
 * integrator; the ramp lookup; the perspective size divide and its minimum of
 * two pixels; the quad's corner order; the two-ramp alternation; the beam pool's
 * size, its per-frame reset and its 40-byte record; the timed list's 28-byte
 * record, its timer and its dedup; the hexagon generator; the
 * beam face sets; the glint's colour band, its mesh, its two draw paths and its
 * band records; the debris burst's velocity draw, the hull it moves in, and the
 * mover's gravity, terminal velocity and no-gravity flag; every constant in
 * `q2_fx_preset`.
 *
 * MODELLED: nothing in the effect system. Two things are the CALLER's to supply
 * because the original takes them from outside the effect code — the gravity
 * step, which the shared mover reads from the same global the player's does,
 * and the glint's band data, which a level script writes through its import
 * table. Both are passed in rather than invented here.

/*
 * `0x800CABC0`..`0x800CAD10` is twelve 28-byte records, walked every frame by
 * `0x80048CA8`, which ticks each timer down by the frame delta and re-submits
 * the live ones into the transient pool. So unlike a queued beam — which lives
 * one frame — a timed beam PERSISTS, and it is the only effect in the game that
 * outlives the frame that made it without being an entity.
 *
 *     +0x00  s16 timer     down by [0x800B2DB4] per frame, clamped at 0
 *     +0x04  s16 clip      handed to the pose lookup at 0x8006CC44
 *     +0x06  s16 radius
 *     +0x08  ptr           the thing the near end is derived from
 *     +0x0C  ptr           the entity the far end sits on
 *     +0x10  tube, +0x14 cap_near, +0x18 cap_far
 *
 * **The BFG fills it.** `0x80049CF0`, inside `0x80049B9C`, which the BFG's tick
 * calls at `0x8004BD04` every frame while the ball flies. It runs a visibility
 * test (`0x80051874`) and then either refreshes the existing entry for that
 * pair of things or takes a free slot, with a timer of **45** and a radius of
 * **64**, drawn in beam style **3** — the green one.
 *
 * That is the classic BFG behaviour: the ball shoots a beam at everything it
 * can see, and each beam lingers after the ball has moved on because its timer
 * has to run down first. It is a weapon trail in every sense that matters, and
 * an earlier pass here concluded the game had none — because every *particle*
 * spawn site is an impact or a death, which is true and is not the whole story.
 *
 * It also corrects the claim that beam styles 3 and 4 are unreachable. They are
 * not reached from the laser dispatcher; they are reached from here. Style 4 —
 * the opaque red one — is filled at `0x8004E9F4` (`addiu t1, v0, -9644`, the
 * style-4 record 0x8009DA54), behind the same visibility test (0x8004E9D4); which
 * weapon or creature drives that one is not yet attributed.
 *
 * 0x8004E9F4 is 0x5C into `0x8004E998`, a separate function whose only
 * reference is its address materialised at 0x8007DB4C. It is NOT inside
 * `0x8004E920`, which this note used to say: 0x8004E920 is a small complete
 * function that ends at 0x8004E994 (`jr ra`), and it is the point-clip-and-area
 * helper — `*area = 0x80055054(pos, entity+0x54, entity+0xA2)`, then the clipped
 * point back from [0x800C8EB8] and the area from [0x800C8EAA] — that both gib
 * throwers use to place a chunk (0x8005A504, 0x8005B1E8). It constructs no

 * The draw at 0x8006AA44 gates on bit 0x04000000 of entity +0x10C, and NOTHING
 * IN THE EXECUTABLE EVER SETS IT. All thirty-nine writes to +0x10C were checked
 * and the largest bit any of them raises is 0x8000; the only site in the whole
 * image that materialises 0x04000000 into a general register is the test
 * itself. Read from the executable alone the glint is dead code.
 *
 * It is not dead. BIGGUN's `LevelBin` — the level script, which is a
 * RELOCATABLE MIPS MODULE, not bytecode — carries both halves, at file offsets
 * 0x18650 and 0x187B8 of its COMMON.DAT:
 *
 *     lw   v0, 268(a0)      ; ent+0x10C

 * The second site tests the same bit and resets `sh 4, 702(a0)` — ent+0x2BE,
 * the PHASE.
 *
 * That last one is the check that the band formula was read right: the phase
 * starts at 4 and 0x80064D3C counts it down, which is exactly what makes
 * `(width / 4) * (4 - phase)` sweep the band from one end of the mesh to the
 * other. A formula with the subtraction the other way round would have looked
 * just as plausible and swept backwards.
 *
 * So the answer to "which entity states raise the flag" is: the level script
 * does, on the one map that ships a mesh, and no engine state does. A port
 * cannot reproduce it without running BIGGUN's script — which is why the
 * client does NOT draw a glint by default. Inventing an entity to wear one

 *                    do not cancel).
 *

 *
 *     +0x00  s16 angle[3]   its own orientation, composed with the entity's

 * and the rest of the engine's services. So the level script owns both the flag
 * and the band data — the effect system's job is to consume them, and that is
 * what is reconstructed here.
 *
 * The per-band phase decrement is a PLAIN byte step that underflows: 0x80064DEC
 * is `addiu v0, a3, 255` with no clamp and no reload, so a band that runs past
 * zero wraps to 255 and lights nothing for the next ~250 ticks. Refreshing it is
 * the script's job too, and wrapping it back to the start here would be the port
 * inventing a reload the console does not perform.
 *
 * It happens inside the DRAW in the original, which is why a two-viewport frame
 * would advance every band twice. This port steps it in `q2_fx_glint_advance`
 * on the tick instead — the glint's one divergence.

 * `LevelBin` is a relocatable MIPS module, and this project does not execute
 * one. It does not have to: the question "does this level raise a glint, and
 * with what" is answerable by READING the module, and reading modules is
 * something the project already does.
 *
 * `q2_fx_glint_scan` looks for the instruction triple that raises the flag —
 *
 *     lw   rX, 0x10C(rY)
 *     lui  rZ, 0x0400
 *     or   rX, rX, rZ
 *
 * — and, when it finds one, picks up the two immediates the surrounding code
 * writes: `sb <n>, 0x2B7(rY)` for the band count and `sh <n>, 0x2BE(rY)` for
 * the phase. So the port takes the script's own numbers rather than a
 * hardcoded 6 and 4, and a map whose script uses different ones gets those.
 *
 * This is general rather than a special case for BIGGUN: any build, any map,
 * any script. A map whose script does not raise a glint gets none, which is
 * every map but one on this disc.
 *
 * WHICH ENTITY it attaches to is the one part that still needs the script to
 * run. The search loop at chunk `+0x1868` walks 48 records of 768 bytes and
 * takes the one whose `+0xD2` is 46 and whose `+0xDA` is 20 — a kind tag and a
 * sub-id, both written by the spawner (`0x8007D700` stores 47 into `+0xD2` for
 * a different kind). The rule is recorded here so that the lookup becomes exact
 * the moment the port's entity records carry those two fields; until then the
 * caller supplies the position and this module does not guess one.

 * — a 16x16 patch in the bottom-right corner of a page. Both the page and the
 * palette are zero-filled bss, written when images are registered at load time,
 * and both are resolvable anyway.
 *
 * THE PAGE. `0x8001AD14` picks between two of those globals by a menu item's
 * face size: size 8 takes `[0x800DDD5A]` and anything else `[0x800DDD56]`. The
 * 8-pixel face is `chars.lbm` — hudtables.h — so the particle and the small
 * menu font are on the SAME PAGE, and a particle is the 16x16 corner of the HUD
 * atlas rather than an image of its own.
 *
 * THE PALETTE. `0x800E3FC2` is not a standalone global, which is why an
 * address-level sweep finds no writer for it: the allocator materialises
 * `0x800E3F2C` and reads `+150`. `0x800E3F2C` is the CLUT-id table the boot
 * palette loop at `0x8007610C` fills — one entry per built-in palette, indexed
 * by the record's own id, and hudtables.h already decodes the whole bank. So
 * the particle's palette is **built-in palette 75**, three below the box ramp's
 * 76 and three above the font's 72.
 *
 * `q2_fx_use_hud_atlas` wires up both from a map's own VRAM.
 *
 * A caller with no VRAM at all gets `untextured`, which emits a flat quad of
 * the ramp's colour instead — visible, honest, and NOT what the hardware drew.
 * It is a fallback rather than a reconstruction, and it is a separate flag so
 * nobody has to guess which they are looking at.

 * exists: a mesh sampled in world units would lose fifteen sixteenths of its

 * (0x8002FF84 `sh v0, 102(a3)`).
 *
 * `pts` must have `count` entries and `vel` must have `count` entries.
 *
 * AREA. 0x8002FED0 calls 0x800686C4 with the caller's area byte and the point

/* THE MESH DRAWERS — five effects that sample an actor's own posed vertices  */

/*
 * 0x80058C18, 0x80058DDC, 0x80058FA0, 0x80059168 and 0x8005899C/0x8005AB70.
 * None of them existed in this port; nothing drew a damage effect at all.
 *
 * They all work the same way. Take the entity's model, ask 0x8006D6AC how many
 * vertices it has in total, walk them with a STEP and a PHASE taken from the
 * engine's tick counter [0x800B2DE4], turn each sampled index into a world
 * point through 0x8006CC44, and hand a batch of at most fifteen points to
 * q2_fx_group_spawn_points. The phase is what makes the effect crawl: on
 * successive frames a different subset of the mesh lights up.
 *
 * THE PHASE IS NOT A SKIP. Reading `s4 = tick & 1` as "every other frame it
 * skips one" loses the effect: the walk STARTS at vertex (tick & 1) and steps
 * by two, so the two halves of the mesh alternate frame by frame and the
 * result is a crawl over the whole body. Same for the spark's `tick & 7`.
 *
 * THE LOOP DOES NOT STOP AT ONE BATCH. 0x80059130 branches back to 0x80059034
 * while two or more vertices remain, so a sixty-vertex soldier spawns TWO
 * groups per tick, not one. A model big enough spends several pool slots a
 * frame out of a pool of 32 (INFERRED, from the arithmetic rather than seen:
 * a crowded scene will run the pool dry and drop later bursts whole).
 *
 * VELOCITIES. The four "crackle" drawers zero all fifteen velocity triples
 * (0x80058FF8: fifteen memsets of six bytes) so the quads sit still on the
 * body. The spark draws random ones; see q2_fx_mesh_spark.
 *
 * THE VIEW MASK IS A SKIP MASK. 0x800590D8 reads the word at group+0xC4, clears
 * bits 4..7 with 0xFFFFFF0F and ORs in `((1 << p) & 0xF) << 4` where
 * `p = (client - 0x800C7C60) / 224` (0x800590E4..0x80059110 is the exact-divide
 * idiom: multiply by 0xB6DB6DB7, which is inv(7) mod 2^32, then `sra 5` — the
 * same divide by 224 playerdeath.h already uses). So the burst is hidden in the
 * viewport of the player it belongs to and visible in everyone else's: you do
 * not see your own damage crackle, you see the other player's. Pass the player
 * index as `viewport_skip`, or -1 for an actor with no client.
 *
 * The renderer's side is 0x80030614..0x80030628: `lbu +0xC4`, `srl 4`, `srav`
 * by the viewport, `andi 1` — bit 4 + n hides a group in viewport n, which is
 * exactly the nibble written here.
 */

/*
 * Where a world point comes from.
 *
 * 0x8006CC44(entity, s16 index, s32 out[3]) is the posed WORLD vertex: it walks
 * the model's 8-byte part records at obj+0x28 to find which part owns the index,
 * applies that part's live pose through 0x8006C6C8, rotates the result by the
 * ENTITY's own matrix (0x8006FC1C on entity+0x2C0) and adds entity+0xA4. A
 * negative index short-circuits to the entity origin (0x8006CC64 `bltz`). The
 * part walk only picks the POSE — the vertex itself is fetched by the original
 * global index (0x8006CCA4 uses the pre-walk value), not by the residue.
 *
 * THIS PORT HAS NO SUCH FUNCTION and cannot grow one here. src/formats/model.c's
 * q2_model_get_vertex returns the RAW STORAGE vertex in model-local space, and
 * src/game/modeldraw.c's `shadow_pose_vertex` does the part walk and the pose
 * but stops in MODEL space and is static — neither applies the entity rotation
 * or its origin, so neither is what 0x8006CC44 returns. Writing a third copy of
 * the pose walk inside effect.c would be worse than asking for one, so the
 * drawers take the lookup as a callback and the presentation layer supplies it.
 * The intended body is a public world-vertex helper in modeldraw.c layered on
 * the existing static one: pose (0x8006C6C8), rotate by the instance's own
 * matrix (0x8006FC1C), add the origin (0x8006CD58..0x8006CD94).
 *
 * Until something supplies it, every caller passes `src == NULL` and every
 * drawer takes the console's model-less path, documented at each one. The
 * timers and the lights are exact either way; the quads are missing, and so
 * are some GENERATOR DRAWS. `src == NULL` is exact only for an entity that
 * genuinely has no model. The spark's one early exit is a null model pointer
 * (0x800589D8 `lw a0, 16(s7)` / 0x800589E0 `beq a0, zero`), so on an actor
 * that HAS a model the console draws its 45 velocities (0x80058A08..
 * 0x80058AB4) on every firing, whether or not the vertex walk then finds
 * anything; handed no mesh, the port draws none. So while the mesh source is
 * missing, each effect[0], effect[2] or effect[4] firing on a modelled actor
 * leaves the port's stream 45 draws behind the console's.
 *
 * `total` is 0x8006D6AC: the SUM of each part's `lbu +3` over the `lh 22(obj)`
 * records at `lw 40(obj)`, not the model header's own vertex count — the
 * original sums rather than trusting the header and the two are not guaranteed
 * equal. A NULL model gives zero (0x8006D6AC returns 0 for a null argument),
 * and every drawer below then does exactly what the console does with a
 * model-less entity, which is documented at each one.

 *
 * Because `colour = ramp[32 - life]`, the life decides where in the ramp the
 * burst starts, so these two numbers together are the whole visual. The

 *                                 (0,255,0), (0,191,0), (0,127,0), (0,63,0):
 *                                 it starts at FULL green and fades out over
 *                                 its four ticks.
 *   0x80058DDC  ramp 17  life 1   the energy-bolt hit, effect[1] >= 3. Every
 *                                 entry of ramp 17 is (0,255,0), and life 1
 *                                 reads entry 31 alone: one tick of undimmed
 *                                 green, re-spawned every frame while the
 *                                 timer holds.
 *   0x80058C18  ramp 15  life 1   the QUAD DAMAGE shell. Life 1 reads ONLY
 *                                 entry 31 (0x8009C29C), which is (0,0,63),

 *                                 (0,0,255) of entries 0..28 is never shown.
 *                                 So the shell is a single tick of dim blue,
 *                                 one frame deep, and exists only because the
 *                                 gate re-spawns it every frame.
 *   0x80059168  ramp  0  life 4   effect[5]'s crackle. Ramp 0 opens at
 *                                 (64,64,255), but life 4 shows entries 28..31

/*
 * Three byte-identical wrappers reach it — 0x8005B624, 0x8005B658 and
 * 0x8005B68C — and they exist only because the compiler emitted one per call
 * site. All three pass a1 = a2 = 0x8009C198 (ramp 14), a3 = 32767 and a fifth
 * argument of 4.
 *
 * Ramp 14 opens at (255,255,125) and passes through orange, but the colour a
 * burst shows is ramp[32 - life] (see the crackle table above), and at life 4
 * that is entries 28..31, 0x8009C20C..0x8009C218: (96,16,16), (76,16,16),
 * (56,16,16) and (36,16,16). So the spark is a DARK-RED ember that dims over
 * four ticks. The yellow and orange part of the ramp is never reached.
 *
 * THAT 4 IS THE LIFE, NOT A QUAD COUNT. It lands at the wrapper's sp+16, which
 * 0x80058B2C reads back as sp+0x170 and 0x80058B4C forwards to 0x8002FDFC's
 * sp+20, which 0x8003001C stores at +0xC5. The burst is up to FIFTEEN quads
 * sourced from the mesh, not four. Every downstream reading of "a four-particle
 * burst" inherits the same misread.
 *
 * Both ramp arguments are the SAME pointer, which matters: the renderer swaps
 * its two ramps every three quads (0x80030A14), so a site that wanted stripes
 * would pass two. This one deliberately does not.
 *
 * THE VELOCITY DRAW is the expensive part and the part that has to be exact,
 * because the generator is shared. Fifteen quads, THREE draws each, 45 per
 * burst, in this order (0x80058A08..0x80058AB4):
 *
 *     A = rand()                     ; the delay slot at 0x80058A14 uses A
 *     B = rand()
 *     angle = A & 0xFFF              ; 4096-step circle
 *     mag   = 32 + ((12 * (B - 16384)) >> 13)      ; ARITHMETIC shift, floor
 *     vel.x = f(sin12(angle) * mag)
 *     C = rand()
 *     vel.y = (C - 16384) >> 10                    ; arithmetic, -16..15
 *     vel.z = f(cos12(angle) * mag)
 *
 * `mag` is 32 +/- 24, giving [8, 55]. `sll 1; addu; sll 2; sra 13` is
 * (x*12)>>13 — dropping the final `sll 2` and reading it as (x*3)>>13 gives
 * [26, 37], a burst with a quarter of the console's spread in speed.
 *
 * f(t) is 0x80058A4C..0x80058A64: `mult t, 0x057619F1 / mfhi / sra 8 / subu
 * (t>>31)`, i.e. the top half of a 64-bit product shifted a further eight, then
 * the sign correction — the compiler's whole signed magic-division sequence.
 *
 * IT IS A DIVIDE BY 12000, and this had to be re-derived because an earlier
 * reading of the constant was wrong. 0x057619F1 is 91625969 decimal, and
 * ceil(2^40 / 12000) is 91625969 exactly; 91625969 * 12000 overshoots 2^40 by
 * 224, which is the residue a magic for 12000 at shift 40 is supposed to have.
 * The misread value, 91760113, would have implied a divisor of 11982.457 and
 * no integer at all — and "no integer divisor fits" was then taken as proof of
 * a hand-rolled fixed-point scale. The bytes at 0x800589FC (`lui s6, 0x576`)
 * and 0x80058A00 (`ori s6, s6, 0x19F1`) settle it.
 *
 * `t / 12000` in C, truncating toward zero, was measured against the multiply
 * over every t in +/-300000 (the site's own reach is +/-225280, from a 1.3.12
 * sine times a magnitude of at most 55) and agrees on all 600001 of them. It is
 * still written as the multiply below, because that is the instruction sequence
 * and the equivalence is a measurement rather than a definition.
 *
 * These are VELOCITIES, not offsets: they go into 0x8002FDFC's a1 array, which
 * is the velocity block. The POINTS all come from the mesh.

/*
 * A BLASTER BOLT'S ONLY BODY.
 *
 * The missile sweep's per-tick arms are all gated on one halfword, the flags at
 * record+0x22 that the spawner writes from its fifth argument (0x8004D7BC).
 * Five bits, five arms:
 *
 *     0x01  0x800482B0   THIS — a particle group, every tick
 *     0x02  0x800481C0   the dynamic light (0x80075C34)
 *     0x04  0x80047F44   the eight-corner body (0x800B1E28)
 *     0x08  0x80048660   the impact burst
 *     0x10  0x80048238   a second, larger light — no caller on this disc sets it
 *
 * and the three callers of the spawner pass exactly two values: 11 for the
 * blaster (0x8004C11C) and for a monster's (0x800620D4), 14 for the
 * hyperblaster (0x8004D3E8) and for a monster's hyper variant (0x800620BC,
 * chosen by `andi v0, 0x40` at 0x800620A8). 11 has bit 0x1 and not 0x4; 14 has
 * 0x4 and not 0x1. So the two are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE: the blaster's bolt is
 * this trail and nothing else, and the hyperblaster's is the box and has no
 * trail. A port that drew the box for both and trailed neither had them
 * exactly the wrong way round.
 *
 * WHAT THE ARM BUILDS, 0x800482B8..0x800485DC, per tick:
 *
 *     disp      = velocity * the frame's dt   (0x80047D50, [0x800B2DB4])
 *     origin    = pos - disp/2                (0x80048328 `sra 17`)
 *     step      = (disp << 4) / record+0x4A   (0x80048384 `sra 12`, then div)
 *     offs[0]   = -(disp/2)                   (0x80048434)
 *     offs[i]   = offs[i-1] + step            (0x800484A8)
 *     vel[0]    = disp >> 4                   (0x80048364 `sra 20`)
 *     vel[i]    = (disp >> 4) + ((rand() - 16384) >> 12)   three draws an axis
 *
 * and hands them to the offsets spawner with count = record+0x4A, both ramps
 * 0x8009BF04 and the operands below (0x80048550..0x8004858C). `offs[0]` is
 * discarded by that spawner — particle 0 IS the origin — so the first entry
 * exists to seed the chain and nothing else.
 *
 * The outer loop runs record+0x42 times, a counter clamped to record+0x3A; the
 * spawner writes 1 there for every caller (0x8004D7B4), so it is always one
 * pass and the counter is a mechanism with no live second case on this disc.
 * Modelled as one pass, with the clamp stated rather than reproduced.

 *     8005B8A0  lh  s1, 264(s0)               ; entity+0x108, health
 *     8005B8A8  jal 0x80058638(entity, 1)     ; effect[1], and it ticks ITSELF
 *     8005B8AC  slt s1, zero, s1              ; (delay slot) dt_alive, taken
 *                                             ; BEFORE 0x80058638 runs
 *     8005B8B4  jal 0x8005B6F4(entity, s1)    ; effect[0] -> mesh spark

 *     8005B8D4  jal 0x8005B7E4(entity)        ; the quad shell
 *     8005B8E0  jal 0x8005B830(entity, 1)     ; effect[5] -> crackle ramp 0
 *
 * EACH TICKER IS `if (slot) { emit(); slot -= dt; }` (0x8005B708..0x8005B72C
 * and its three clones). The emit is unconditional on the timer being non-zero
 * and the decrement uses the CALLER's dt, so:
 *
 *   - slots 0 and 2 get dt = (health > 0). On a DEAD body zero is subtracted
 *     every tick, so an armed effect[0] or effect[2] does not run down at all:
 *     the spark keeps firing for as long as the body is presented.
 *   - slots 4 and 5 get a literal 1 (0x8005B8D0, 0x8005B8E4 — and the same in
 *     the dissolve handlers at 0x8005B3EC/0x8005B400 and 0x8005B494/
 *     0x8005B4A8), so they run down whether the entity is alive or not.
 *
 * WHAT ENDS A SPARKING CORPSE is not this chain; it is the corpse think's gate
 * 0x8005B2A8. Both corpse thinks call it BEFORE they would call 0x8005B880 —
 * the player's 0x8003E238 at 0x8003E244, the creature's 0x8007F71C at
 * 0x8007F728 — and skip the chain when it returns non-zero:
 *
 *     8005B2B4  lbu  v0, 754(a0)     ; effect[2] set -> think = 0x8005B444
 *     8005B2D4  lbu  v0, 752(a0)     ; else effect[0] set -> think = 0x8005B39C
 *     8005B2EC  sw   v0, 60(a0)      ; (either arm) install it at +0x3C,
 *     8005B2F4  sh   v0, 244(a0)     ; +0xF4 = 4096 (0x8005B2F0 addiu),
 *     8005B304  jal  0x8007F288      ; on the +0x2EC record, and return 1
 *
 * (0x8007F288 zeroes that record's +0x24 and clears bit 0x20000000 of its
 * +0x1C.) The two handlers are byte-for-byte the same code. Each runs the
 * whole chain above, dt_alive included, and then drains +0xF4 by
 * `[0x800B2DB4] << 6` a frame (0x8005B408..0x8005B418, 0x8005B4B0..
 * 0x8005B4C0), freeing the entity through 0x8006D280 once the halfword is no
 * longer positive (0x8005B420 `bgtz`, 0x8005B428). So on the console a corpse
 * with effect[0] or effect[2] armed sparks for ceil(4096 / (64 * dt)) more
 * frames, six at the nominal dt of 12, and is then GONE. It does not spark
 * for the rest of the level. effect[1], [4] and [5] do not trigger the swap;
 * they run down on their own.
 *
 * This function is the chain only. The gate, the swap and the free belong to
 * the corpse's owner, and are modelled there: q2_monster_corpse_tick
 * (0x8007F728) and q2_player_death_tick_fx (0x8003E244) run 0x8005B2A8 on
 * the body's own effect bytes before anything else.
 *
 * Reading the health gate as applying to all four is still a real mistake:
 * it would latch effect[4] and effect[5] on a dying body, where the console
 * runs them down.
 *
 * effect[3] (+0x2F3): `q2psx-inspect access 0x2F3` finds no load or store
 * whose immediate is 0x2F3 anywhere in SLES_015.34, so nothing here reads or
 * decrements it. That is a measurement of the MAIN EXECUTABLE's immediate-
 * offset accesses only: the tool does not scan the relocated creature and
 * level modules, and it cannot see base+index addressing. No module is known
 * to touch the byte, and 0x8005B880 certainly does not, which is all this
 * function needs. effect[5] (+0x2F5) IS real: 0x8005B844 reads it and
 * 0x8005B868 writes it back.
 *
 * THE QUAD SHELL'S GATE (0x8005B7E4) is five instructions: entity+0x0C must be
 * non-null (0x8005B7EC, so an actor with NO CLIENT never gets a shell however
 * its inventory reads), then client+0xAC against the level clock at
 * [0x800AEBAC] with `sltu` (0x8005B80C) — an UNSIGNED compare, and strict, so
 * `level_time == quad_until` is already over.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. The two lights and the ambient write that 0x80058638
 * raises belong to lighting.c, so they are REPORTED rather than raised: fill in
 * a q2_fx_present_report and let the driver act on it. That keeps effect.c
 * presentation-only, which is the shape the rest of this module already has.

 * WHICH HULL DEBRIS MOVES IN, and it is not the player's.

 * slot, then calls the shared mover. Its twin at `0x80046DDC` is the one that
 * uses SecondaryCol and `+0xA2`, and that is the player's path.
 *
 * So debris is traced against the UNERODED hull with its own cell index, while
 * the player is traced against the hull eroded by 286 (sim.h). Using the
 * player's hull for debris would stop every shard 286 units short of the floor
 * and leave it hanging in mid-air — which reads as a physics bug rather than a
 * hull mix-up.
 *
 * The radius is `a2` at the call site: 2048.

 *     vel.y += [0x800AE924] * frame_delta   ; the SAME global the player uses
 *     if (vel.y > 8192) vel.y = 8192        ; terminal velocity
 *
 * Three things follow that a plausible model would have got wrong: the step is
 * gravity times the FRAME DELTA rather than a flat per-tick add; the fall speed
 * is capped, so a shard dropped down a lift shaft stops accelerating; and the
 * value is the simulation's own, which is why `q2_fx_debris_step_one` takes it
 * from the caller instead of keeping a second copy that could drift from the

 * fixed block at 0x800D4B24, and the spawn at 0x800596B0 hands them over with
 * count 15, life 10, size 10000 and area entity+0x9E. The numbers in the table
 * were right; only the name and the ramp rule were wrong.
 *
 * The ramp comes from bits of `s3`, and `s3` is `lw 68(s2)` — entity+0x44, the
 * ITEM's own flag word. The instruction immediately after the spawn,
 * 0x800596B8 `andi v0, s3, 0x70`, is the glow-light test that item.c already

 *
 * The selection chain has no final else (0x80059648 / 0x8005965C / 0x80059670
 * each `beq` forward to the next test, and the last falls through to the spawn
 * with s4 untouched). An item with none of the three bits reaches the spawn
