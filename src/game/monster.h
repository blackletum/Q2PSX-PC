/*
 * monster.h — the creature entity model and the animation frame driver.
 *
 * The PSX AI is a port of PC Quake II's monster code, and this is no longer an
 * inference: the whole framework has been read out of the executable and the
 * numbers land on id's own constants once the world scale is applied. Every
 * address quoted below is in `SLES_015.34`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * How a creature is driven
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `monster_start_go` (0x80061BA4) points the entity's think at
 * `M_MoveFrame` (0x8006175C) and sets `nextthink = level.time + 1`. From then
 * on the engine calls it once per AI tick, and it does three things:
 *
 *   1. advance the animation by one frame within the current move,
 *   2. run the frame's movement verb with the frame's distance,
 *   3. run the frame's think index against the creature's own method table.
 *
 * There is no separate `monster_think` wrapper — the PSX put the ground and
 * water checks in the generic entity physics, so the think IS the frame driver.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The method table, which is what makes a creature a creature
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A creature module does not export named callbacks. It registers handlers
 * into a two-level table built by 0x80061D10:
 *
 *     void (*classMethods[256][32])(edict_t *)      base 0x800D519C
 *
 * Every one of the 256 class slots starts out pointing at one shared 32-entry
 * table (0x800D559C) filled with a do-nothing handler (0x80062624), so an
 * unregistered class is inert rather than a crash. A module claims a slot by
 * calling the setter at 0x80061DE4 — which the loader hands it as import
 * +0x118 — once per method it implements.
 *
 * The 32 slots split in two at index 26:
 *
 *     [0..25]   `think` handlers, selected by an animation frame's think byte
 *     [26..31]  the creature's OWN movement verbs, selected by a frame whose
 *               ai byte has bit 7 set: index = 26 + (ai & 0x7F)
 *
 * That is why the frame census finds `ai` in {0..5} and {129..133} and `think`
 * in 0..19: two disjoint ranges into one table. A local verb is called with
 * only the entity — it gets no distance, because a creature that steers itself
 * does not want the frame's.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Animation
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A move is a frame range plus a per-frame script and an optional end callback:
 *
 *     q2_mmove   16 bytes  { s32 first; s32 last; frames*; endfunc }
 *     q2_mframe   3 bytes  { u8 ai; s8 dist; u8 think }
 *
 * The three-byte frame is worth noticing: it is not padded to four. A reader
 * that assumes alignment walks off the end of every animation. 0x80061890
 * computes the frame address as `frames + index*3` with an explicit
 * shift-and-add, which is the proof.
 *
 * Distance travelled on a frame (0x80061930..0x8006196C):
 *
 *     dist = (aiflags & AI_HOLD_FRAME) ? 0 : (dist * scale * 12) / 10
 *
 * The /10 is a magic-number division by 10 in the original, not a shift.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scale, angles and axes — three things a port gets wrong silently
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **World scale is 12, not 10.** Every length constant in the AI is id's own
 * number times twelve, and they were read independently: melee 1020, near 6000
 * (id 500), mid 12000 (id 1000), step height 216 (id 18), chase-direction
 * deadband 120 (id 10), flyer height bands 480 and 360 (id 40 and 30), the
 * corner-peek sidestep 192 (id 16). Six unrelated constants agreeing on one
 * factor is not a coincidence. Note this is the AI's scale; other subsystems
 * were established at 10, so the two are genuinely different and neither is a
 * mistake in the other's reading.
 *
 * **Angles are 4096 to the turn.** `anglemod` (0x8005C7B8) is one instruction:
 * `and 0xFFF`. 180 degrees is 2048 and 90 is 1024, and the sidestep in
 * ai_run_slide is literally `± 1024`.
 *
 * **The vertical axis is Y, and it points DOWN.** Movement is built as
 * (sin, 0, cos) so the ground plane is XZ, yaw is atan2(x, z), and the height
 * comparisons in SV_movestep have exactly id's four branches with their signs
 * mirrored. A port that assumes Z-up gets monsters that will not climb steps.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The clock
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 10 ticks per second. Established arithmetically before and confirmed by the
 * AI: `idle_time = level.time + 150 + random()*150` where id waits 15 + 15
 * seconds, `search_time = level.time + 50` where id waits 5, the dead-monster
 * pause of 1e9 where id uses 1e8. This is NOT the 25 Hz simulation tick.

     * go-routine the wrapper parked.
     *
     * `model_ext2` is the halfword at obj+0xF8, which the loader fills from the
     * creature's own model — 0x80056700 `jal 0x8006D100` / 0x80056710 `sh v0,
     * 248(s0)`, and 0x8006D100 is `lw v0, 16(a0); if (!v0) return 0; return

 * per creature per frame in which its health changed, with the health already

/*
 * A FLAGGED CREATURE LEAVES AMMO, HEALTH OR A WEAPON, and it is decided by a
 * table indexed on its POPULATION CLASS ROW, not by an `item` field.
 *
 * The chain, disassembled end to end:
 *
 *  (a) 0x800622E8 monster_death_use. 0x80062318 `lw a0, 36(a0)` takes the link
 *      object, 0x80062330 tests bit 0x100 of its +0xF2 (Q2_SPAWNFLAG_DROP_ITEM
 *      above) and 0x8006233C `jal 0x80020D60`. `xrefs 0x80020D60` gives exactly
 *      two JALs — 0x8003976C, the player-death drop, and this — so it is a real
 *      entry and not a label.
 *
 *  (b) 0x80020D60 only RECORDS; it spawns nothing. Four 88-byte slots run from
 *      0x800C6D70 to 0x800C6ED0 (0x80020D6C `addiu v1, a1, 352`, 0x80020D8C
 *      `addiu a1, a1, 88`; 352/88 = 4 exactly). It takes the first slot whose
 *      halfword at +0 is zero, and IF NONE IS FREE IT RETURNS HAVING DONE
 *      NOTHING — 0x80020D74 and 0x80020DA4 both branch to the `jr ra` at
 *      0x80020E1C. So a fifth creature dying in one frame drops nothing, and
 *      that silent overflow is reproduced here rather than papered over.
 *      Then slot[+0] = 1, slot[+2] = `lhu obj+0xD2` (the class row), slot[+4] =
 *      0 in single player, and 80 bytes of obj+0x54..0xA3 — the collision
 *      volume, which begins with the position — are copied into slot+8.
 *
 *  (c) 0x80020E24 runs once a frame from 0x80038FE0, walks the four slots and
 *      hands each used one to 0x80020680 (0x80020E5C).
 *
 *  (d) 0x80020680 clears slot[+0] and picks an item id through the 30-entry
 *      jump table at 0x800AB79C, indexed `(s16)(slot[+2] - 5)` and bounded by
 *      `sltiu v0, v1, 30` at 0x800206E8. See q2_monster_drop_item_for_class.
 *      A zero id stops there (0x800207D0 `beq s0, zero, 0x80020848`); anything
 *      else draws ONE rand() (0x80020820 `jal 0x80089E28`), keeps its low
 *      twelve bits (0x8002082C `andi a1, v0, 0xFFF`) and calls the spawner.
 *
 *  (e) 0x8002085C is the DROP spawner, and it is not the placed-item one.
 *      `xrefs 0x8002085C` gives exactly one caller, 0x80020840 above. It does
 *      not go through the placement routine 0x80050FA0 at all: the recorded
 *      position is copied straight to the new item's +0x54 (0x800209C4), with
 *      no 286 lift and no floor sweep, because it is already a live entity's
 *      origin. The twelve random bits are not a facing — the item's angles are
 *      zeroed (0x80020AC8) — they index the {sin, cos} table at 0x800A5430 as
 *      the HEADING OF A TOSS (0x80020A2C), and two more rand() draws inside the
 *      spawner give its speed and upward kick. Its think is 0x80020C48, which
 *      lets the item fall and settles it into the ordinary item think
 *      0x80059330 once it lands. What the port hands over is the REQUEST —
 *      q2_monster_drop_request, below — and the spawning is the host's.
 *
 * entity+0xD4, which in id's monster_death_use is `self->item`, is CLEARED at
 * 0x80062314 and the chain above never reads it: 0x80020D60 is handed the
 * link object and reads only its +0x0C, +0xD2 and +0x54..+0xA3. id's
 * `Drop_Item(self, self->item)` was replaced by the class-table path, so there
 * is no second drop route to be missing.

 *                 a1, 0x80` / 0x8005C908 `bne`), and every movement link in

 *                 creature that has moved that copy is almost never taken.
 *                 What keeps +0x54 current is the object's per-frame handler
 *                 0x8007EBC4 (materialised at 0x8007E5A8): it turns the gap
 *                 from +0x54 to +0x20 — where link_entity's bit-0 copy DOES
 *                 put the edict origin, 0x8005C8E0..0x8005C900 — into the
 *                 halfwords at +0xEC..+0xF0 (0x8007ED08..0x8007EDC4), runs the

 *                 edict leaves +0x54 behind it; the port does not model that.
 *
 * The fifth argument, `lh 78(a3)` at 0x80020838, is obj+0xA2 — the cell the
 * creature's origin was last found in — and becomes the item's own +0xA2. The
 * port keeps no such field on a creature, so it is not carried; the host finds
 * the cell for `pos` itself. a2 points at six zero bytes (0x800207D8) that the

/*
 * A BODY STOPS BEING A CREATURE, and this port had no such step at all.
 *
 * The console keeps two linked structures: the ACTOR (health at +0x108,
 * gib_health at +0x44, collision volume at +0x54, per-tick handler at +0x3C,
 * entity at +0x2EC) and the ENTITY. When a creature's own `*_dead` raises
 * SVF_DEADMONSTER, `0x8007EC28` calls `0x8007F098` and the two come apart:
 *
 *     0x8007F0A8/B0  gib_health  is copied from entity+0x52 onto actor+0x44
 *     0x8007F0B4/BC  max_health  is copied from entity+0x50 onto actor+0x48
 *     0x8007F0C8     entity+0x24 = 0            — the entity loses its actor
 *     0x8007F0D0     entity+0x1C &= 0xDFFFFFFF  — bit 29, the edict is FREED
 *     0x8007F0DC     actor+0x2EC = 0            — the actor loses its entity
 *     0x8007F0E4     actor+0x3C  = 0x8007F71C   — the per-tick handler becomes
 *                                                 the CORPSE handler
 *     0x8007F0E0     the collision volume is rescaled (below)
 *     0x8007F0F4     actor+0xD2 = 47, with the old class saved to +0xDA
 *
 * (The port writes that 47 into `class_id`, the module's class byte, and saves
 * the byte in `corpse_was_class`; `pop_class_id`, its copy of +0xD2, keeps the
 * row. So the value the console saved at +0xDA is `pop_class_id` here, still
 * in place — which is what anything wanting the dead creature's class row
 * reads.)
 *
 * From that tick on there is no edict, which is why `movetype` is written on
 * death by every module and read by nothing: there is nothing left to read it
 * off. A console corpse does not fall because a console corpse is not an
 * entity any more.
 *
 * THE VOLUME RESCALE, 0x8007F77C, is two divides on the actor's own box:
 * `+0x96 /= 4` (0x8007F794, an arithmetic shift with the usual +3 bias) and
 * `+0x94 = (3 * +0x94) / 2` (0x8007F79C..0x8007F7B4). So a body becomes half as
 * tall again as it is wide and a quarter as tall as it was — id's
 * `self->maxs[2] = -8` generalised. That is what stops a corpse blocking a
 * doorway at head height.
 *
 * THE HANDLER, 0x8007F71C, makes four calls, in this order:
 *
 *     0x8007F728  jal 0x8005B2A8   the DISSOLVE GATE (below). If it answers
 *                                  non-zero, 0x8007F730 `bne v0, zero,
 *                                  0x8007F76C` returns at once: none of the
 *                                  other three runs on that tick.
 *     0x8007F738  jal 0x8005B880   the presentation chain — the ambient fade
 *                                  0x80075E14, the damage-effect hooks
 *                                  0x80058638/0x8005B6F4/0x8005B744/0x8005B794/
 *                                  0x8005B830 and the quad shell 0x8005B7E4.
 *                                  effect.h has it as q2_fx_actor_present. It
 *                                  advances no animation.
 *     0x8007F740  jal 0x800552B4   append the body to the ACTOR LIST: a
 *                                  32-entry buffer at gp+17824 that 0x8005525C
 *                                  swaps each frame into 0x800B2B90..
 *                                  0x800B2B98. The hitscan hands those two
 *                                  ends to the entity sweep 0x800544EC
 *                                  (0x80048908..0x8004891C), and radius
 *                                  damage walks them (0x80050884). It is what
 *                                  keeps a body SHOOTABLE. It is not a draw
 *                                  list.
 *     0x8007F764  jal 0x8007CEB4   the destruction dispatcher, taken when
 *                                  `slt v0, v0, v1` at 0x8007F754 (gib_health
 *                                  < health) is 0: health <= gib_health.
 *
 * So a settled corpse is still checked for gibbing every tick, against the
 * threshold it copied at detach, unless the gate has taken it first.
 *
 * THE DISSOLVE GATE, 0x8005B2A8. Both corpse handlers call it first: this one
 * at 0x8007F728, the player's 0x8003E238 at 0x8003E244 (playerdeath.h). `xrefs`
 * finds those two JALs and no other reference.
 *
 *     8005B2B4  lbu  v0, 754(a0)   effect[2] (+0x2F2) set: v0 = 0x8005B444
 *     8005B2D4  lbu  v0, 752(a0)   else effect[0] (+0x2F0) set: v0 = 0x8005B39C
 *                                  neither set: branch to 0x8005B2F8 and write
 *                                  nothing
 *     8005B2EC  sw   v0, 60(a0)    the handler goes into +0x3C
 *     8005B2F4  sh   v0, 244(a0)   +0xF4 = 4096 (0x8005B2F0 addiu)
 *     8005B304  jal  0x8007F288    on the +0x2EC record
 *     and it returns s0, 1 if either byte was set.
 *
 * The two handlers are the same 168 bytes (`q2psx-inspect bytes` of
 * 0x8005B39C and 0x8005B444, compared), so which one goes in records only
 * WHICH BYTE WAS SET. effect[2] is read first and wins when both are.
 * effect[1], [3], [4] and [5] do not open the gate. Each handler runs the
 * presentation chain (the seven calls of 0x8005B880, inlined, dt_alive
 * included) and then:
 *
 *     8005B404  lw   v1, [0x800B2DB4]   the frame's dt
 *     8005B410  sll  v1, v1, 6
 *     8005B418  sh   v0, 244(s1)       +0xF4 -= dt << 6, as a halfword
 *     8005B420  bgtz                   still positive: that is all
 *     8005B428  jal  0x8006D280(self)  otherwise the body is FREED
 *
 * There is no 0x800552B4 call and no gib test in either handler. From the
 * gate on, the body is off the actor list, so nothing can hit it and nothing
 * can gib it. It is still drawn, because the per-frame entity walk below
 * still takes it, and it still sparks: effect[0] and [2] tick by dt_alive,
 * which is 0 on a body, so they never run out. That lasts until
 * 4096 has drained at 64 per dt, which is 64 dt: six frames at the nominal
 * 12 (Q2_DT_NOMINAL). Then the body is gone. A corpse whose killing blow
 * armed effect[0] or [2] (Q2_MOD_2, Q2_MOD_4; combat.c q2_mod_effect_timer)
 * therefore dissolves on its first corpse tick. It does NOT gib, however far
 * past gib_health it is, because the gate comes before the gib test.
 *
 * +0xF4 IS NOT A DRAW PARAMETER. `q2psx-inspect access 0xF4` lists every load
 * and store with immediate offset 244 in the main executable (the relocated
 * modules are not scanned). The loads that run over every entity in a frame
 * test only zero or sign:
 *
 *     0x8006ABC0  `lh` / `beq zero`  the per-frame entity walk 0x8006AB8C (one
 *                                    caller, 0x80077420) skips a zero +0xF4,
 *                                    which is a freed slot: 0x8006D280 zeroes
 *                                    it at 0x8006D2D8. It skips an entity with
 *                                    no model at +0x10 too.
 *     0x8006DCC4  `lh` / `blez`      in 0x8006DC88, which that walk calls
 *     0x8006B038  `lh` / `bgez`      the light gather (0x8006B040, lighting.c)
 *
 * Nothing the presentation chain calls touches it. The census has no access
 * between 0x8004BF28 and 0x800597D4 (0x80058638, the mesh emitters, and the
 * effect[5] emitter 0x80059168..0x8005932C; 0x800597D4 is the item think
 * 0x80059330's), none between the drain at 0x8005B4C0 and 0x80064234
 * (0x8005B6F4..0x8005B880 and their emitters), and none between 0x80072EBC
 * and 0x80079AD4 (0x80075E14). In 0x8005B2A8..0x8005B4EC the only accesses
 * are the gate's store and the two drains. A dissolving body's +0xF4 is in
 * (0, 4096], so it takes the same arms it took before. Nothing fades,
 * shrinks or turns translucent. What the player sees is the body vanish when
 * the free lands.

 * actor list is `takedamage = Q2_DAMAGE_NO`, because the port's sweeps skip a
 * body on that and not on list membership (combat.c, nearest_hit). The
 * presentation is not the corpse tick's in this port. simcombat.c presents
 * every creature actor every frame, and the mesh hook stops handing a posed
 * mesh over once `in_use` goes, so the sparks end with the free. One
 * difference: the console skips the chain on the gate's own tick, and the

 * THE THREE START WRAPPERS — 0x80062240 walk, 0x8006229C fly, 0x80062268 swim.
 *
 * What a module's spawn function calls last, through import +0xFC, +0x100 and
 * +0x104 (the loader fills those three slots at 0x8007DCD4, 0x8007DCE0 and
 * 0x8007DCEC). Each does exactly two things before `jal 0x800619E0`
 * monster_start:
 *
 *   0x80062240  sw 0x8006241C, 148(a0)       parks the walk go-routine
 *   0x8006229C  sw 0x800624BC, 148(a0)       parks the fly go-routine
 *               lhu/ori 0x1/sh +0x20         FL_FLY, 0x800622B4, the `sh` in
 *                                            the jal's delay slot
 *   0x80062268  sw 0x8006255C, 148(a0)       parks the swim go-routine
 *               lhu/ori 0x2/sh +0x20         FL_SWIM, 0x80062280
 *
 * So the flag arrives AT SPAWN, from the wrapper, before the creature has ever
 * thought — not when it wakes. These record which go-routine was parked in
 * `start_kind` and raise the wrapper's flag.
 *
 * AND THEN THEY DRAW A RANDOM NUMBER, because the jal is not the end of them.
 * monster_start's last act (0x80061B1C..0x80061B8C) picks a random start frame
 * in the move the module installed: `if (currentmove) frame = first + rand()
 * % (last - first + 1)`, the rand() being `jal 0x80089E28` at 0x80061B2C —
 * the same BIOS routine as the module's import +0x14. So a wrapper call
 * consumes ONE draw whenever the module has set `currentmove`, and it
 * consumes it at the call site, in the middle of the module's own draws.
 * These three do that too (monster.c, monster_start_frame).
 *
 * The rest of what this port models of monster_start is not here but in
 * q2_creature_spawn (crebind.c): SVF_MONSTER and takedamage before the
 * module's spawn hook, and the total_monsters count after it, because the
 * count reads the AI_GOOD_GUY bit the module sets.
 *
 * A module that says nothing is a walker: the other six of the disc's seven
 * modules end their spawn with +0xFC (each transcription cites its own site —
 * the Soldier's is `lw v0, 252(s0)` at module+0x173C), and the Insane takes
 * +0xFC or +0x100 on its prone bit (cre_insane.c).
 *
 * ONLY THE INSANE CALLS THESE YET. The other six transcriptions do not call
 * q2_monster_walk_start at their +0xFC site, so on this port they get neither
 * the random start frame nor the draw that makes it: the shared stream is one
 * draw short for each of them whose module has a move installed by then (the
 * Soldier's own stand call at +0x1734 and the Arachner's `currentmove = Stand`
 * both come first). Each module's spawn has to be checked for draws either
 * side of its call before the call can simply be added; that is not done
 * here.
