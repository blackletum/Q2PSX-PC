 * THE WAKE CENSUS — every creature every map places, woken the way the client
 * wakes it, and what its eye and turn rate came out as.
 *
 * The decode above says what each module IS. This says what the port DOES with
 * it once a map is loaded. q2_creature_world_load spawns the records and runs
 * each module's spawn hook, which is where the Insane picks the fly or the
 * walk wrapper on its prone bit (module+0x974). Each creature's `model_ext2` is
 * then filled from its own CastList model — the halfword the console's loader
 * writes to obj+0xF8 at 0x80056710, and what the client's creature model loop
 * has to copy from the q2_model it resolves, before it wakes the world — and
 * q2_creature_world_wake runs q2_monster_start_go, which dispatches to the
 * go-routine the wrapper parked. Leave the fill out and every walker below
 * comes out at the stand-in, which is the check this census exists to make.
 *
 * What that must give, off the three go-routines (`ai` pins the immediates): a
 * walker's eye is ~ext2 (0x80062450 `nor`) and it turns 228 (0x80062438); a
 * flyer's eye is a flat -250 (0x800624F0) and a swimmer's -100 (0x80062584),
 * and both turn 114 (0x800624E8, 0x8006257C). A creature whose model could not
 * be found keeps the port's -290 stand-in (monster.c, q2_monster_start_go) and
 * is counted rather than hidden.
 *
 * Then the two sound substitutions modules make in their own spawn code
 * (creature.c, k_sound_fallbacks): the Soldier's pain trio (module+0xE50) and
 * the Tank Commander's idle, overwritten with its footstep (module+0x808). On
 * every map that places one, what the host plays must be a name that map's
 * SNDVRAM bank carries.
